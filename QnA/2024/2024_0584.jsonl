This \nprovides that where a person fails to claim within the time prescribed, that person \nwill not be paid in respect of any period more than 6 months before the claim is \nmade. \n\nThese Regulations amend the prescribed time for making a claim for State \nPension (Contributory) so that a claim may be made up to 6 months before the \ndate the person becomes entitled to State Pension (Contributory). \n\nFrom end October 2024, an online application form for state pension \n(contributory) and state pension (non-contributory) will be available to \nclaimants.
