MASTER PROMPT — Generate Gold QA in ObliQA / Rayo et al. Format (Multiple Files, 2 Expert-Level QAs per File)
Context

You are building a gold-standard legal QA dataset to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, following the ObliQA schema from Rayo et al. (COLING 2025).
This dataset is intended for expert-level benchmarking of retrieval precision, recall, and faithfulness in regulatory/legal contexts.

Outputs must strictly follow this JSON schema:

{
  "QuestionID": "uuid",
  "Question": "…",
  "Passages": [
    {
      "DocumentID": 20200244,
      "PassageID": "7.3.4",
      "Passage": "The passage text …"
    }
  ],
  "Group": 1
}

Input format

You will receive between 1 and 10 JSONL files, each introduced with a header line like:

File: si-2020-0244.jsonl


followed by that file’s full JSONL content.
Each JSONL line includes:

"doc_id"

"parent_doc_id" (used to derive DocumentID)

"si_number"

"title"

"year"

"section_id", "section_label"

"text_raw" (use this verbatim for QA)

"text_norm" (ignore this)

Each file = one Irish Statutory Instrument (S.I.).
Each must be processed independently.

Task

For each file:

Extract "parent_doc_id" → convert to integer DocumentID (remove "si-" and dashes; keep digits).
Example: "si-2020-0244" → 20200244.

Read all "text_raw" sections.

Generate exactly 2 expert-level ObliQA-style QA entries per file.

Output all entries (2 × N files) as one JSON array.

Mapping rules

DocumentID (integer)
Numeric form of "parent_doc_id" (e.g., "si-2020-0346" → 20200346).

PassageID (string)
From "section_id":

reg-2 → "2"

reg-12 → "12"

schedule-1 → "S1"

explanatory-note → "EXPL"

Include subsection markers: (2)(b) → "3.2.b"

Passage (text)
Use verbatim text_raw (no summarizing).
If long, keep only the minimal continuous span needed to answer the question.

Question writing requirements (strict)

Each question must simulate a trained legal researcher or policy compliance officer asking something that tests legal comprehension — not just recall.
Do not produce trivial metadata questions like:

“What is the title of this Regulation?”

“When was this Regulation made?”

“What year is stated?”

Instead, questions must reflect legal intent, scope, application, or enforcement, such as:

Normative questions (Obligations / Permissions / Prohibitions):

“Who is required to maintain records under these Regulations?”

“What must an operator do before carrying out an inspection?”

“Under what circumstances may an authority revoke a licence?”

Conditional / Exception questions:

“In what situations does this Regulation not apply?”

“What exemptions exist for employers with fewer than 50 employees?”

Procedural questions:

“What steps must be taken before a notice is issued under Regulation 6?”

“Who must be notified when a breach is detected?”

Interpretive / Definition questions:

“How is a ‘relevant premises’ defined under these Regulations?”

“What constitutes a ‘qualified person’ under Regulation 4?”

Enforcement / Sanction questions:

“What penalties apply for failing to comply with Regulation 8?”

“Which authority is responsible for enforcing these Regulations?”

Operational / Interactional questions:

“How does Regulation 7 interact with the requirements set out in Regulation 5?”

“What information must be provided when submitting an application?”

Output format

Return only a valid JSON array, no commentary or markdown.
Example:

[
  {
    "QuestionID": "9a64b7f1-53ac-4c78-9a92-232c789d4d92",
    "Question": "Under what circumstances may a relevant person refuse a passenger entry to a public transport vehicle?",
    "Passages": [
      {
        "DocumentID": 20200244,
        "PassageID": "7.1",
        "Passage": "7. (1) Where a relevant person reasonably believes that a person travelling by public transport vehicle ... may refuse the passenger entry to a public transport vehicle."
      }
    ],
    "Group": 1
  },
  {
    "QuestionID": "b8d4d8f2-1ae4-45cb-8147-4c6a9d9ebbc5",
    "Question": "Who is authorised to enforce compliance with these Regulations and what powers do they have?",
    "Passages": [
      {
        "DocumentID": 20200244,
        "PassageID": "9",
        "Passage": "9. (1) A member of the Garda Síochána or a relevant person may take such steps as are necessary to ensure compliance with these Regulations, including..."
      }
    ],
    "Group": 1
  }
]

Quality control checklist

Before returning, confirm:

No trivial or administrative questions.

Each question targets a substantive legal rule, condition, definition, or consequence.

The passage fully supports the answer, with minimal unrelated text.

The JSON is valid and flat (no comments, markdown, or explanations).

Exactly 2 QA pairs per file are produced.

Workflow summary

Input: between 1–10 JSONL file blocks, each starting with File: filename.jsonl.

For each file:

Derive numeric DocumentID from parent_doc_id.

Analyze all text_raw sections.

Generate exactly 2 expert-level legal QA pairs.

Merge all entries into one JSON array and return only that array.
