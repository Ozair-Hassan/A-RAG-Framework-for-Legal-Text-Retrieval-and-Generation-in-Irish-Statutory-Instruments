In accordance with \nthe regulations, this instrument establishes a point system, which will apply to \nthe Licence Holder of a sea-fishing boat when a serious infringement of the \nCommon Fisheries Policy is detected within the Exclusive Fishery Limits of the \nState or for an Irish vessel, wherever it may be. The Sea Fisheries Protection \nAuthority is determined as the competent authority for the establishment of the \nsystem and the assignment of points. The Licensing Authority is the competent \nauthority for the recording of points assigned to the licence of an Irish registered \nfishing vessel and for the transfer of those points. \n\nThis Statutory Instrument provides for the establishment of a Determination \nPanel comprised of 3 independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney \nGeneral to determine if on the balance of probabilities a serious infringement \noccurred. The instrument also establishes an independent Appeals Officer to \nreview the decision of the Determination Panel on the request of the licence \nholder. \n\nThe accumulation of points for persistent serious infringements of the Common \nFisheries Policy will lead to the suspension of a sea fishing boat licence for a \nperiod from 2 months to one year. In extreme cases persistent serious fisheries \ninfringements could lead to the permanent withdrawal of a licence. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f22 [318] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \n52 FAICHE STIABHNA, BAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 2, \nD02 DR67. \n\nTeil: 076 110 6834 \nr-post: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \n52 ST.
