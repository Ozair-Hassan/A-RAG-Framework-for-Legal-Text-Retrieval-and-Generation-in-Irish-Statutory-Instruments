Parts 2-3 of Schedule 2 provide for increases to the maximum \nrate of Disablement Gratuity and the weekly rates of Disablement Pension \nwhere the degree of disablement ranges from 100 per cent to 20 per cent. \n\nThese Regulations provide for increases in the rate of Disablement Gratuity \nand the weekly rates of Disablement Pension where the degree of disablement \nranges from 1 per cent to 19 per cent. The rates provided for in Schedule 3 \napply in respect of a continuing disablement of between 1 and 19 per cent \nwhich arose prior to 1 January 2012. Schedule 3A applies where the \ndisablement occurs after 1 January 2012 and in such a case, disablement \ngratuity and gratuity pension are payable only where the range of disablement \nis greater than 14 per cent. \n\nThe Regulations also provide for an increase in the rate of Injury Benefit \npayable to persons under the age of sixteen. If, in such a case, there is what \namounts to full-time employment, or substantially full-time employment, the \nrate will increase by €12.00 (from €208.00 to €220.00). This is the same rate as \nthe maximum rate payable to an adult. In all other cases the rate will increase \nby €5.70 (from €99.50 to €105.20). \n\nThe rate increases, provided for by these Regulations, come into effect on 02 \nJanuary 2023 in the case of Injury Benefit and on 06 January 2023 in the case \nof Disablement Gratuity and Disablement Pension to coincide with the \nincreases in rates provided for by the Social Welfare Act 2022. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f8 [618] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€ 3.00 \n\n(DEASP-150) 75. 11/22.
