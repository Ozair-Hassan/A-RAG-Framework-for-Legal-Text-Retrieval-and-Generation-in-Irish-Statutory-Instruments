If you give a disqualification undertaking for the disqualification period, \nthe legal effect for you will be that you will be disqualified during the \ndisqualification period from being appointed or acting as a director or other \nofficer, statutory auditor, receiver, liquidator, or examiner or being in any \nway, whether directly or indirectly, concerned or taking part in the \npromotion, formation or management of each of the following: \n\n• a private company limited by shares; \n• a designated activity company; \n• a public limited company; \n• a company limited by guarantee; \n• an unlimited company; \n• an unregistered company; \n• any friendly society within the meaning of the Friendly Societies \n\nActs 1896 to 2014; \n\n• any society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies \n\nActs 1893 to 2014; \n\n• an Irish Collective Asset Management Vehicle (ICAV). \n\nB. Following the submission of the undertaking, your name will be entered \ninto the Register of Disqualified Persons maintained by the Registrar of \nCompanies. This will be accessible by the general public for the duration \nof the period of your disqualification. \n\nBreach of disqualification undertaking \n\nC. If you fail to comply with the terms of your disqualification undertaking, \nyou are liable to be prosecuted for a criminal offence under section 855 of \nthe Act. If convicted of such an offence you are liable to a fine and/or \nimprisonment and, in addition, the imposition of a further disqualification \nfor a period of ten years or such other period, (shorter or longer), as the \ncourt may prescribe. Under section 859 of the Act, it is also possible that \nyou could be held personally liable, without any limitation of liability, for \nall or part of the debts or other liabilities of any company in relation to \nwhich you have acted in a manner or a capacity which you are prohibited \nfrom doing by virtue of being subject to a disqualification undertaking. \n\nAny person who acts in accordance with your instructions during your \nduration of disqualification is also liable to be prosecuted for a criminal \noffence. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f10 [646] \n\nOther effects \n\nD. You will be deemed for the purposes of the Act to be subject to a \ndisqualification order, being an order of the type ordinarily made by the \ncourts under section 842 of the Act. This may give rise to consequences \nunder a variety of other legislative codes. For example, you would cease to \nbe qualified to hold certain offices (e.g., as a member of the Charities \nRegulatory Authority or the Competition and Consumer Protection \nCommission). Similarly, the fact that you were or had been deemed subject \nto disqualification order might have a bearing on whether you could be an \nattorney under an enduring power of attorney. \n\nRelief application \n\nE. Even where you give a disqualification undertaking, section 847 of the Act \npermits you to apply to the High Court subsequently seeking to be relieved \n(whether in whole or in part) from the disqualification. The court may \ngrant such relief only if it considers it just and equitable to do so, and then \nonly on the terms and conditions that the court sees fit. Furthermore, the \nAuthority reserves the right to oppose any such application. In this regard, \nyou should also note that, as part of your acceptance of a disqualification \nundertaking, you will have accepted that the underlying facts and \ncircumstances outlined in Part B are not disputed. \n\nNo obligation to give an undertaking \n\nF. There is absolutely no obligation on you to give an undertaking. \nHowever, if you decide that you do not wish to voluntarily submit to a \ndisqualification undertaking, then you should be aware that it is likely that \nan application will be made to the High Court to have you disqualified. \nYou should be aware that if the court decides to make a disqualification \norder against you, it could be for a duration which is longer than the \nduration indicated in this document. \n\nG. You should also keep in mind that the courts may direct that the \ndisqualified person shall bear not just the costs of the application to court, \nbut also some, or all, of the costs incurred by the Corporate Enforcement \nAuthority, the Director of Public Prosecutions, a liquidator, receiver or \nexaminer, in investigating the matter and in collecting evidence in respect \nof those matters including such portion of the applicant’s remuneration and \nexpenses as are attributable to such investigation and collection. \n\nH. Where you decline to give the undertaking within the deadlines specified \nand on the terms outlined in this document and an application to have you \ndisqualified is subsequently made under section 842 of the Act arising from \nor in connection with the underlying facts and circumstances, it will not be \nopen to you to seek to settle, or discontinue, those legal proceedings by \noffering an undertaking at some later date. Under section 851(6) of the Act \nthe Authority is specifically precluded from offering a disqualification \nundertaking once a disqualification application has been made to the High \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f[646] 11 \n\nCourt (including any application of which the Authority is aware brought \nby anyone else such as a liquidator or a receiver). \n\nRecommendation to obtain independent legal advice \n\nI. The foregoing is simply an outline of the key legal effects, under Irish \nstatute law, for a person who has given a disqualification undertaking. In \nparticular cases, the giving of such an undertaking might also have \nconsequences in private law, for example, under a contract of employment \nor in a contract relating to the lending of money. It is not possible in a \ndocument of this sort for every conceivable legal effect to be stated \ncomprehensively, in a manner which is appropriately tailored to the \nparticular circumstances of particular persons. \n\nJ. Accordingly, it is strongly recommended that you should seek \nindependent legal advice before deciding to give a disqualification \nundertaking. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f12 [646] \n\nSECOND SCHEDULE

The requirements referred to in section 819(3) are— \n\na. the company shall have an allotted share capital of nominal \n\nvalue not less than— \n\ni. €500,000 in the case of a public limited company (other \nthan an investment company) or a public unlimited \ncompany, or \n\nii. €100,000 in the case of any other company, \n\nb. each allotted share shall be paid up to an aggregate amount not \nless than the amount referred to in paragraph (a), including the \nwhole of any premium on that share, and \n\nc. each allotted share and the whole of any premium on each \n\nallotted share shall be paid for in cash. \n\nC. In the case of a company limited by guarantee, the following \n\nrequirements shall apply instead of the foregoing: \n\na. that the company’s memorandum of association specifies that \nthe amount of the contribution on the part of the member of it, \nor at least one member of it, being the contribution undertaken \nto be made by the member as mentioned in section 1176(2)(d), \nis not less than €100,000; \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[646] 19 \n\nb. that the member whose foregoing contribution is to be not less \nthan that amount is an individual, as distinct from a body \ncorporate. \n\nD. In the case of an investment company or an Irish Collective AssetManagement Vehicle (ICAV), the subsection shall be read as if it set \nout both of the following requirements— \n\na. that the value of the issued share capital of the company or \n\nICAV is not less than €100,000, \n\nb. that an amount of not less than €100,000 in cash has been paid \nin consideration for the allotment of shares in the company. \n\nE. Following the submission of the undertaking, your name will be entered \ninto the Register of Restricted Persons maintained by the Registrar of \nCompanies. This will be accessible by the general public for the \nduration of the period of your restriction. \n\nBreach of restriction undertaking \n\nF. If you fail to comply with the terms of your restriction undertaking, you \nare liable to be prosecuted for a criminal offence under section 855 of \nthe Act. If convicted of such an offence, you are liable to a fine and/or \nimprisonment and, in addition, the imposition of a period of \ndisqualification. Under section 859 of the Act, it is also possible that \nyou could be held personally liable, without any limitation of liability, \nfor all or part of the debts or other liabilities of any company in relation \nto which you have acted in a manner or a capacity that you are \nprohibited from doing by virtue of being subject to a restriction \nundertaking. \n\nOther effects \n\nG. You will be deemed for the purposes of the Act to be subject a \ndeclaration of restriction, being an order of the type ordinarily made by \nthe courts under section 842 of the Act. This may give rise to \nconsequences under other legislative codes. For example, the fact that \nyou were or had been deemed subject to restriction under the \nCompanies Act might have a bearing on whether you could be an \nattorney under an enduring power of attorney. \n\nRelief application \n\nH. Even where you give a restriction undertaking, section 822 of the Act \npermits you to apply to the High Court subsequently seeking to be \nrelieved (whether in whole or in part) from the restriction. The court \nmay grant such relief only if it considers it just and equitable to do so, \nand then only on the terms and conditions that the court sees fit. \nFurthermore, the Corporate Enforcement Authority reserves the right to \noppose any such application. In this regard you should also note that, \nas part of your acceptance of a restriction undertaking, you will have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f20 [646] \n\naccepted that the underlying circumstances, facts and allegations \noutlined in Part B are not disputed. \n\nNo obligation to give an undertaking \n\nI. There is absolutely no obligation on you to give an undertaking. \nHowever, if you decide that you do not wish to voluntarily submit to a \nrestriction undertaking, then you should be aware that it is likely that an \napplication will be made to the High Court to have you restricted. \n\nJ. You should also keep in mind that the courts may direct that the \nrestricted person shall bear not just the costs of the application to court \nbut also some or all of the costs incurred by the Corporate Enforcement \nAuthority, the Director of Public Prosecutions, a liquidator, receiver or \nexaminer, in investigating the matter and in collecting evidence in \nrespect of those matters such portion of the applicant’s remuneration \nand expenses as are attributable to such investigation and collection. \n\nK. Where you decline to give the undertaking within the deadlines \nspecified and on the terms outlined in this document and an application \nto have you restricted is subsequently made under section 820 of the \nAct arising from or in connection with the circumstances, facts and \nallegations, it will not be open to you to seek to settle or discontinue \nthose legal proceedings by offering an undertaking at some later date. \nUnder section 853(6) of the Act, the Corporate Enforcement Authority \nis specifically precluded from offering a restriction undertaking once an \napplication to the High Court has been made (including any application \nof which the Corporate Enforcement Authority is aware brought by \nanyone else such as a liquidator or a receiver). \n\nRecommendation to obtain independent legal advice \n\nL. The foregoing is simply an outline of the key legal effects under Irish \nstatute law for a person who has given a restriction undertaking. In \nparticular cases, the giving of such an undertaking might also have \nconsequences in private law, for example, under a contract of \nemployment or in a contract relating to the lending of money. It is not \npossible in a document of this sort for every conceivable legal effect to \nbe stated comprehensively, in a manner which is appropriately tailored \nto the particular circumstances of particular persons. \n\nM. Accordingly, it is strongly recommended that you should seek \nindependent legal advice before deciding to give a restriction \nundertaking. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[646] 21 \n\nTHIRD
