No. 641 of 2022", "title": null, "year": 2022, "heading": "(This note is not part of the Instrument and does not purport to be a legal", "text_raw": "EXPLANATORY NOTE \n\n(This note is not part of the Instrument and does not purport to be a legal \ninterpretation.) \n\nBackground to the Statutory Instrument \n\nThe Government approved the establishment of a Ukraine Credit Guarantee \nScheme on 27th of July 2022, to facilitate participating finance providers \nlending up to €1.2 billion to SMEs, primary producers and small mid-caps (i.e. \ncompanies under 500 employees). \n\nThe Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2022 completed its passage through \nthe Oireachtas over the course of 9th to 16th November (Dáil) and 23rd to 30th \nNovember (Seanad), and was signed into law by Uachtarán na hÉireann on 2nd \nDecember 2022 last, as Act No. 38 of 2022. \n\nThe Ukraine Credit Guarantee Scheme has been developed to adhere to the \nprovisions of the European Commission’s “Temporary Crisis Framework for \nState Aid measures to support the economy following the aggression against \nUkraine by Russia”. This allows for such schemes to support the needs of \nenterprises responding to the economic shock caused by the Ukraine crisis. The \nTemporary Crisis Framework for State aid measures allows for the relaxation \nof certain State aid rules for a limited time to enable EU Member States to \nsupport enterprises in their country. The Temporary Crisis Framework is \ncurrently due to expire on 31 December 2023. \n\nThe Scheme will ensure finance providers are incentivised to support \nbusinesses which require additional liquidity in order to respond to the changed \neconomic landscape and the need to adapt and change business practises in \nresponse. \n\nIn order to remain within the terms of the Temporary Crisis Framework, all \nlending under the Temporary Crisis Framework must be agreed before 31 \nDecember 2023, or such later date as the Temporary Crisis Framework may be \nextended to. \n\nThis S.I. establishes the Scheme to operationalise the powers of the Minister \nunder the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 (as amended). \n\nOverview of the Scheme \n\nThis is a scheme for SMEs, Primary Producers and small Mid-Caps. SMEs are \nexpected to be the main beneficiaries. In order to qualify for the Scheme, the \nborrower’s business must be viable, the credit must be new (not for the \npurposes of refinancing existing indebtedness) and the borrower will have to \ndeclare that its costs have increased by a minimum of 10% on its 2020 figures \nand that the credit is being sought specifically due to economic difficulties \nresulting from the aggression against Ukraine by Russia. \n\nThe current standard facility size for the Ukraine Credit Guarantee Scheme will \nbe €10,000 to €1,000,000. \n\n \n \n \n \n\f14 [641] \n\nThe qualifying enterprises will apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of \nIreland (SBCI) for confirmation regarding eligibility to participate in the \nscheme and thereafter will apply as normal to the finance providers for \nfinancial products, such as overdrafts or term loans. The finance providers will \napply their normal underwriting decision-making process to the applications \nfor financial products. \n\nThe qualifying enterprises will pay a premium to the State for the guarantee. \nThe State is required to charge this under the terms of the European \nCommission’s Temporary Crisis Framework for State Aid measures and the \nCredit Guarantee Act 2012 (as amended). \n\nFinance providers are required to provide these financial products at reduced \ninterest rates to the qualifying enterprises, to take account of the reduced risk of \nthe finance providers in the case of any default arising. This will further \nsupport businesses to access essential liquidity as a result of the Ukraine crisis. \n\nThe Scheme has been designed to ensure it can be distributed and accessed as \nefficiently as possible. However, the European Commission’s Temporary \nCrisis Framework for State Aid Measures and the De Minimis Regime, where \napplicable, must be adhered to in order to take advantage of the derogations \nand increased State aid limits within the Scheme. \n\nThe Scheme will be operated by the SBCI. The SBCI will also review \nprospective finance providers and make a recommendation to the Minister \nregarding their participation in the Scheme. \n\nComponents of the S.I. \n\nThe S.I begins with the formal Citation for the Scheme and Interpretations and \nDefinitions applicable for the Scheme. \n\nIt then consists of two substantive parts; \n\nPart two sets out an overview of the Ukraine Credit Guarantee Scheme. This \nincludes: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nThe policy objectives of the Scheme to facilitate additional lending to \nbusinesses in response to the economic difficulties caused by aggression \nin Ukraine by Russia. \n\nThe powers of the Minister to grant a guarantee subject to the conditions \nspecified in section 4 and section 4B of the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 \n(as amended). \n\nThe facility and guarantee term applicable under the Scheme. \n\nThe nominal values of financial products that are allowable under the \nScheme. \n\nThe nature of finance agreements that are considered as eligible credit \nunder the Scheme. \n\nThe requirement to charge a premium as part of a credit agreement under \nthe Scheme to a participating enterprise availing of the Scheme. \n\n \n \n\f[641] 15 \n\n• \n\n• \n\nThe application of a pricing discount, which participating finance \nproviders are required to include on qualifying finance agreements under \nthe Scheme in order to pass on the financial benefit of the State \nguarantee. \n\nSupport under this measure constitutes State aid within the meaning of \nArticle 107(1) TFEU. The Commission considers that it is compatible \npursuant to Article 107(3)(b) of the TFEU since it meets all the relevant \nconditions of the Temporary Crisis Framework. On expiry of the \nTemporary Crisis Framework (to the extent the Temporary Crisis \nFramework is not extended), assistance through this Scheme will be \nprovided in reliance on the De Minimis Regime. \n\n• \n\nConfirmation of compliance with data protection law. \n\nPart three describes the process of approval of finance providers to this Scheme \nand refers to the participating finance provider’s legal agreement. \n\n \n \n \n \n\f16 [641] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€ 3.50 \n\n(FFG-6) 75. 12/22.
