Analysis of job data: evaluation \nThere are many different types of job evaluation models76 and \nit is a matter for each organisation to choose the method best \nsuited to it or to adapt a particular model as necessary77. The \nevaluation model (or method) used must be neutral in respect \nof any aspects of jobs generally done by a protected group (for \nexample, by women, by non-Irish employees, by employees \nwith a disability): these aspects of the job must not be undervalued as this would simply perpetuate any pay inequality. \nin organisations where \nThis \noccupational segregation is a factor. Job evaluation models to \ndate have focused on the elimination of gender inequality in \npay, however these models are just as relevant to eliminating \nnon-gender pay inequality. The most important aspects of a \njob evaluation are set out below: \n\nis particularly \n\nimportant \n\n• Assessment: Jobs are assessed on the basis of the \ninformation collected and a value is assigned, usually \na points value; \n\n75 For example, criteria such as financial knowledge will be of great significance for a job in financial management and \ntechnical knowledge will be of paramount importance in a job dealing with information technology, but these factors \nwill not feature in a job involving refuse collection or landscaping of public parks. Sub-factors under these headings \nmight include keeping up to date (e.g. by doing relevant courses) with knowledge of company law and corporate \ntaxation issues or with developments in information technology and Internet law. \n76 See for example Promoting Equity: Gender Neutral job evaluation for equal pay: a step-by-step guide, ILO (2008); \nEquity at Work: An Approach to Gender-Neutral Job Evaluation, State Services, New Zealand; Gender Pay Reviews, \nIBEC (2013); Negotiating for Equality – Gender and Pay Toolkit, ICTU (2003); Equal Pay Handbook, Human Rights \nCommission of Australia (1998); Gender Pay Equity, Fair Work Ombudsman of Australia (2012). \nSee also, for example, those described in Appendix 5 of IBEC’s ‘Gender Pay Reviews – A template for examination of \ngender pay in organisations’, IBEC, 2013; Chicha, Marie-Thérèse, ‘Promoting Equity: Gender neutral job evaluation \nfor equal pay: A step-by-step guide’, ILO, 2008; Negotiating for Equality – Gender and Pay Toolkit, ICTU, 2003;The \nEqual Pay Handbook, Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission of Australia, 1998 and the guidelines in A \nFramework for Building a Culture of Equality and Human Rights in the Workplace, IHREC. \n77 Quantitative or factor evaluation would appear to be the model best suited to equality reviews. This involves \nassessing jobs on a factor-by-factor basis (for example, functional knowledge, training and experience, reporting level \nand accountability, etc.) and assigning points to each factor. \n\n \n \n \n \n\f22 [107] \n\n• Criteria: Most evaluation models suggest similar \ncriteria: \nskills, \nfor example, knowledge and \nphysical/mental skills, responsibility for health and \nsafety, supervision, responsibility for planning and \nfinance. These \ndevelopment, \nfactors/sub-factors are not exhaustive and should be \nadapted as appropriate; \n\nresponsibility \n\nfor \n\n• Stereotypical assumptions about jobs traditionally \nperformed by particular groups should be avoided; \n\n• The weighting of evaluation \n\ninvolves \ndetermining their relative importance (by for example \nusing percentages and points scores) and assigning \nrelative values to each of them: the same weighting \nsystem should be used for all jobs; and \n\nfactors \n\n• A weighting grid78 can be used to indicate the relative \nimportance of each factor and sub-factor: the same \nweighting grid should be used for all jobs.", "text_norm": "76 analysis job data evaluation many different type job evaluation models76 matter organisation choose method best suited adapt particular model necessary77 evaluation model (or method) used must neutral respect aspect job generally done protected group (for example woman non-irish employee employee disability) aspect job must undervalued would simply perpetuate pay inequality organisation occupational segregation factor job evaluation model date focused elimination gender inequality pay however model relevant eliminating non-gender pay inequality important aspect job evaluation set particularly important assessment job assessed basis information collected value assigned usually point value 75 example criterion financial knowledge great significance job financial management technical knowledge paramount importance job dealing information technology factor feature job involving refuse collection landscaping public park sub-factors heading might include keeping date (e.g relevant courses) knowledge company law corporate taxation issue development information technology internet law 76 see example promoting equity gender neutral job evaluation equal pay step-by-step guide ilo (2008) equity work approach gender-neutral job evaluation state service new zealand gender pay review ibec (2013) negotiating equality - gender pay toolkit ictu (2003) equal pay handbook human right commission australia (1998) gender pay equity fair work ombudsman australia (2012) see also example described appendix 5 ibec gender pay review - template examination gender pay organisation ibec 2013 chicha marie-therese promoting equity gender neutral job evaluation equal pay step-by-step guide ilo 2008 negotiating equality - gender pay toolkit ictu 2003 equal pay handbook human right equal opportunity commission australia 1998 guideline framework building culture equality human right workplace ihrec 77 quantitative factor evaluation would appear model best suited equality review involves assessing job factor-by-factor basis (for example functional knowledge training experience reporting level accountability etc.) assigning point factor 22 107 criterion evaluation model suggest similar criterion skill example knowledge physical mental skill responsibility health safety supervision responsibility planning finance development factor sub-factors exhaustive adapted appropriate responsibility stereotypical assumption job traditionally performed particular group avoided weighting evaluation involves determining relative importance (by example using percentage point scores) assigning relative value weighting system used job factor weighting grid78 used indicate relative importance factor sub-factor weighting grid used job", "start_char": 46780, "end_char": 50497, "source_path": "downloads\\2022\\2022_0106.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "checksum": "sha256:ec1a92abd49d27b364eef3a0bc30b2e57941a0b4d92bd98595f2c0e2349b2fe3", "cross_refs": []}
