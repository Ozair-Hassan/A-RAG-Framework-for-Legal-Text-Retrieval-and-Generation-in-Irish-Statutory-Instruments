Given that the standard \nrate has increased in January 2022 to €208, it is necessary to amend the wording \nto ensure that the rate of enhanced illness benefit remains at €350. This \namendment confirms that those incapable of work due to contracting Covid-19 \nor being a probable source of infection will continue to receive a weekly payment \nof €350. \n\nThe Regulations also make two amendments to article 28P to provide for a \ncorrect sectional reference in the Social Welfare Consolidated Act 2005, and to \nprovide for a consistency of language in paragraph (a) and (b) and that a \nmaximum period of two weeks payment is permitted for close contacts. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f[26] 5 \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€3.00 \n\n(DEASP-119) 75. 1/22.
