Two \nprovisions are made: firstly, if the person’s practice is only in the course of \nrendering first aid to a person, and secondly, a person qualified to practise in a \nplace outside the State and in the State for a humanitarian purpose may be \nissued with a permit by the NMBI allowing them to practice for a period not \nlonger than 30 days, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the \npermit. Of note, this permit provision does not apply to nurses and midwives \nwho are eligible to have their qualifications recognised under the European \nUnion (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2017 ( S.I. No. \n8 of 2017) and who, accordingly, are eligible to apply to provide services on a \ntemporary and occasional basis. \n\nSection 44 of the Act updates Section 49 of the Nurses Act 1985 (that is hereby \nnow revoked by Section 4 (1)) by providing for offences and penalties \nregarding Section 39 (see above), Section 43 (misuse of designated titles) and \nfalsely representing to be registered. \n\nSection 45 provides that an unregistered nurse or unregistered midwife cannot \ncharge or recover fees for providing nursing or midwifery services unless they \nwere registered at the time service was provided or the service was provided in \naccordance with Section 41 of the Act. \n\nSection 103 provides that NMBI shall, at the request of the Minister, or may, of \nits own initiative or upon a complaint made by a member of the public, \ninvestigate suspected cases of unregistered \nindividuals practising or \nunregistered individuals claiming to be registered and outlines the relevant \npenalties. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4 [226] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€ 1.50 \n\n(DH-414) 75. 5/22.
