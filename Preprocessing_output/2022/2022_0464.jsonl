The purpose of this amendment is to \nreflect the intent of Article 42A of the Constitution, which was inserted into the \nConstitution by the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Act \n2012 (the \"Children's Referendum\"). The new section 24, as inserted by section \n4, specifies that in any proceedings before a court in relation to the care and \nprotection of a child, under the Principal Act, including proceedings before the \nHigh Court in relation to special care, the court shall regard the best interests of \nthe child as the paramount consideration. \n\nSection 6 makes a number of technical amendments to section 29 of the \nPrincipal Act. It also inserts a new subsection (5B) into section 29. This new \nsubsection provides that the Minister may grant an approval to an official \nwhich will enable that official to attend proceedings under Parts III, IV, IVA or \nVI of the Principal Act for certain specific defined purposes. Section 6 further \namends section 29 by substituting \"relevant documents\" for \"relevant court \ndocuments\" and provides a definition of 'relevant documents' in a new \nsubsection (10). \n\nSection 13 provides for an updated collective citation for the Child Care Acts. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4 [464] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€ 1.50 \n\n(CPPLU-1) 75. 9/22.
