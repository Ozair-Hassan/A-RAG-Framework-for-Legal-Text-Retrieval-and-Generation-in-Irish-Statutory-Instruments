Furthermore, whether a restriction applies must be considered on a \ncase-by-case basis following an assessment of the relevant circumstances. \nWhether it is necessary and proportionate to restrict the right in whole, or in \npart must also be considered. \n\nWhere a right or obligation is restricted, the Regulations provide that IAASA is \nobliged to notify the data subject and provide the reasons for the restriction, \nunless to do so may prejudice the achievement of a relevant objective. A \nnotification must inform the data subject of the right or obligation affected by \nthe restriction, whether the restriction applies in whole or in part, and the data \nsubject’s statutory right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection \nCommission. \n\nThe proposed measures also require IAASA to have in place certain policies \nand procedures relating to safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access or \ntransfer and the storage periods and the applicable safeguards taking into \naccount the nature, scope and purposes of the processing or categories of \nprocessing.
