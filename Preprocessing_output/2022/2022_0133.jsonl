It provides for the “policy of \ninsurance” Head of Charge in Schedule 1 of the Act, which is currently collected \nunder agreements with individual insurance companies, to be abolished and \nreplaced with a quarterly levy under a new section 125C of the Act. Upon \ncommencement of section 125C the €1 stamp duty on insurance policies will \nthereafter be collected quarterly in line with, and on the same basis as, the other \ninsurance stamp duties. Insurers will account for the three stamp duties on a \nsingle statement returned by electronic means to Revenue. \n\nThe Order takes effect from and including 1 April 2022. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4 [133] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€1.50 \n\n(PRDDF-114) 75. 3/22.
