As such, the 2021 Regulations repeal previous Regulations as \nfollows: \n\n(a) European Communities (Re-Use of Public Sector Information) \n\nRegulations 2005 (S.I. No. 279 of 2005), \n\n(b) European Communities (Re-Use of Public Sector Information) \n(Amendment) Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 103 of 2008), and \n\n(c) European Communities (Re-use of Public Sector Information) \n\n(Amendment) Regulations 2015. (S.I. No. 525 of 2015). \n\nThe 2003 and 2013 Directives set out an EU statutory framework for the re-use \nby businesses and citizens of existing information held by public sector bodies \nin new products and services. The 2019 (recast) Directive was published in order \nto address the remaining and emerging barriers to a wide re-use of public sector \nand publicly funded information across the Union, to bring the legislative \nframework up to date with the advances in digital technologies and to further \nstimulate digital innovation, especially with regard to artificial intelligence. \n\nThe main changes, a synopsis of which are set out below are framed so as to \nallow full exploitation of the potential of public sector information: \n\n• The inclusion of ‘Open Data’ in the title provides clarity and strengthens \nthe requirement for public bodies to publish data in open formats. The \n2021 changes also clarify the relationship with other EU legal \ninstruments including the Database (96/9/EC), INSPIRE (2007/2/EC) \nand GDPR (2016/679/EC). \n\n• Regulation 5. The scope of the regime is extended to include public \nundertakings. These refer to entities entrusted with the provision of \ncertain public services (water, energy, transport, postal services, public \ntransport services by rail and road, air carriers or marine transport \nservices) which are funded or governed by public bodies. These \norganisations will retain the discretion to make data available for re-use \nexcept where requested in an EU Implementing Act. Only after the \npublic undertaking has made a document available for re-use, should it \nobserve the relevant obligations laid down as regards format, charging, \ntransparency, licences, non-discrimination and prohibition of exclusive \narrangements. A public undertaking must comply with the High Value \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f28 [376] \n\nDatasets requirements in Regulation 14 except in relation to data that \nwould lead to a distortion of competition in the relevant markets. \nInformation outside the scope of the public service is excluded. \n\n• Regulation 6. Public Undertakings do not have to comply with requests \nfor reuse. The request regime also does not apply to research data. \n\n• Regulation 7. Dynamic data should be made available via APIs \n\n(application programming interface) and bulk download where relevant. \nPublic bodies and public undertakings should where possible, make \npublic service information available in accordance with the principles of \n‘open by design and default’. \n\n• Regulation 8. Re-use free of charge is the default, otherwise charges \nshould be restricted to marginal cost recovery subject to some exceptions \n(public bodies who are required to generate income to cover a substantial \npart of their costs and libraries, museums and archives) where some \ncharges can be applied. In the interests of transparency public bodies \nwho charge, as they are required to generate income to enable them to \nperform their functions, must be included on a published list of such \nbodies. \n\n• Regulation 9. Public bodies or public undertakings who charge for re-use \nmust also publish details of the charges including how they are calculated \non their website. \n\n• Regulation 12. The scope of the regime is extended to include publicly \nfunded research data and national policies will be required aimed at \nmaking this research openly available. \n\n• Regulation 13. Exclusive arrangements for the re-use of public sector \ninformation should not be entered into unless to provide a service in the \ngeneral interest or for the digitising of cultural resources. Where \nexclusive arrangements are entered into, those arrangements must be \nmade publicly available online. Arrangements between data holders and \ndata re-users which do not expressly grant exclusive rights but which can \nreasonably be expected to restrict the availability of documents for reuse should be subject to additional public scrutiny. The essential aspects \nof such arrangements should be published online at least two months \nbefore coming into effect. \n\n• Regulation 14. The Directive introduces powers to establish lists of high \nvalue datasets by means of Implementing Acts. Certain lists of high \nvalue datasets will have to be made available by public bodies and public \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[376] 29 \n\nundertakings for free, in machine readable format, be accessible via APIs \n(application programming interface) and provided as a bulk download, \nwhere relevant. The first such Implementing Act is due to be published \nin Autumn 2021. \n\nNote: These Regulations affect how information can be re-used, once it has been \nlegitimately accessed, by placing obligations on the public sector to the benefits \nof re-users with the aim of boosting economic activity. However, they do not \ncreate any new rights of access to information or override or modify data \nprotection rules in any way. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f30 [376] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \n52 FAICHE STIABHNA, BAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 2, \nD02 DR67. \n\nTeil: 076 110 6834 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \n52 ST.
