The hyperlink: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/habitatsdirective/index_en.ht\nm which connects to the European Commission Environment (Nature and \nBiodiversity) website also contains a further link to the text of the Habitats \nDirective. \n\nThe effect of these Regulations is to complete the formal designation of the site \nas a Special Area of Conservation in accordance with Article 4 of the \nDirective. The geographical area of the Special Area of Conservation \ndesignated by these Regulations is defined in Schedule 1 (a map of the area) \nand Schedule 2 (a list of the townlands in question or a description of the area). \nFor more detailed maps than those contained in Schedule 1, or for greater detail \non boundary delineation, contact should be made with the National Parks and \nWildlife Service of the Department of Housing, Local Government and \nHeritage or by viewing the relevant text or map details on www.npws.ie. \n\nThe natural habitat types and animal and plant species lists cited in Schedule 3 \nof these Regulations are specified, in accordance with the Directive, in order to \nensure their conservation (i.e. the measures required to maintain or restore the \nnatural habitats and the populations of species of wild fauna and flora at a \nfavourable status). The updated list of published conservation objectives \nreferred to in Regulation 3 is available on www.npws.ie. Public authorities \nshould have regard to these objectives when undertaking a screening or \nappropriate assessment of plans or projects in accordance with the EU Habitats \nDirective. \n\nThose activities that require consent of the Minister or in some circumstances \nanother public authority listed at Schedule 4 to these Regulations are cited for \ntheir potential to cause disturbance or damage to the natural habitat types and \nanimal and plant species specified in Schedule 3 of these Regulations. \nLandowners or occupiers should contact the local National Parks and Wildlife \nService office of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage \nbefore undertaking any of the works listed at Schedule 4. (See www.npws.ie \nfor contact details). Please note that activities other than those listed at \nSchedule 4 to these Regulations, such as effluent discharge, construction work, \naquaculture, fishing or forestry require a licence or permission from the \nappropriate consent authority. \n\nThese Regulations provide (Regulations 6 and 7) that contravention of the \nprovisions of these Regulations shall constitute an offence. Regulation 6 also \nprovides for penalties. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f12 [551] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n—————— \n\n€ 3.50 \n\n(DUN-128) 75. 10/21.
