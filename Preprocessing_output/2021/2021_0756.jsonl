Rents can be \nreviewed annually in line with the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices \n(HICP), with formulae set out for how reviews should be undertaken in three \nspecific circumstances: the first rent in any tenancy, the first review of this rent, \nand all subsequent reviews of this rent. All rents calculated are maximum rents, \nmeaning landlords are free to charge the tenant less than this should they so wish. \n\nThe Schedule to these Regulations also prescribes the form of the Rent Review \nNotice to be served by a landlord on a tenant or tenants in a Cost Rental tenancy. \nThis prescribed form of Notice is distinct from the form prescribed for use in \nresidential tenancies other than Cost Rental tenancies, and includes an \nexplanation for how this rent was arrived at, and a declaration by the landlord \nthat the information in the review is correct. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f14 [756] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€3.50 \n\n(CRAU-6) 75. 12/21.
