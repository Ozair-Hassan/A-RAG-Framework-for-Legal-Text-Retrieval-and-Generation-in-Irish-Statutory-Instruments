The hyperlink: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/habitatsdirective/index_en.htm \nwhich connects to the European Commission Environment (Nature and Biodiversity) \nwebsite also contains a further link to the text of the Habitats Directive. \n\nThe effect of these Regulations is to complete the formal designation of the site as a \nSpecial Area of Conservation in accordance with Article 4 of the Directive. The \ngeographical area of the Special Area of Conservation designated by these Regulations \nis defined in Schedule 1 (a map of the area) and Schedule 2 (a list of the townlands in \nquestion or a description of the area). For more detailed maps than those contained in \nSchedule 1, or for greater detail on boundary delineation, contact should be made with \nthe National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Housing, Local \nGovernment and Heritage by viewing the relevant text or map details on www.npws.ie. \n\nThe natural habitat types and animal and plant species lists cited in Schedule 3 of these \nRegulations are specified, in accordance with the Directive, in order to ensure their \nconservation (i.e. the measures required to maintain or restore the natural habitats and \nthe populations of species of wild fauna and flora at a favourable status). The updated \nlist of published conservation objectives referred to in Regulation 3 is available on \nwww.npws.ie. Public authorities should have regard to these objectives when \nundertaking a screening or appropriate assessment of plans or projects in accordance \nwith the EU Habitats Directive. \n\nThose activities that require consent of the Minister or in some circumstances another \npublic authority listed at Schedule 4 to these Regulations are cited for their potential to \ncause disturbance or damage to the natural habitat types and animal and plant species \nspecified in Schedule 3 of these Regulations.
