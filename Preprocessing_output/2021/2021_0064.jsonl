The code \nspecifies the standards of conduct, performance and ethics expected of registered \npodiatrists. \n\nCORU is the Regulator for Health and Social Care Professionals in Ireland. It \ncomprises of the Council and Boards for each of the regulated professions. The \npurpose of CORU is to protect the public by promoting high standards of \nprofessional conduct, professional education, training and competence among \nregistrants. The Podiatrists Registration Board was appointed on the 13 July \n2018 by the Minister for Health, Simon Harris. \n\nIn 2010, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council at CORU developed \na framework code detailing common standards across its constituent boards. The \nframework was reviewed and updated in 2013. The framework was further \nreviewed and updated in 2018. Many of the standards of performance, conduct \nand ethics, expected of podiatrists are common to the health and social care \nprofessions to be regulated by CORU. The Podiatrists Registration Board, made \nup of both lay members and representatives of the profession, have carefully \nconsidered the framework bearing in mind international best practice and public \nconsultation. This Code outlines the standards of ethical behaviour and conduct \nthat the public expects from podiatrists. Each year registrants will be asked to \npledge that they comply with the Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics. It is \nessential that all registrants read, understand and meet the standards set out in \nthis Code as failure to do so could result in a complaint of professional \nmisconduct being made about the registrant. \n\nAs the goal of the Podiatrists Registration Board is to protect the public by \nfostering high standards of professional conduct, education, training and \ncompetence among registrants, adopting this Code is a major milestone in this \nprocess. As the profession develops, the Podiatrists Registration Board is \ncommitted to continually reviewing these standards, to ensure that they remain \nboth relevant and comprehensive. We expect that all podiatrists will comply with \nthese standards and that the consistent application of these standards will benefit \nindividuals. We look forward to working with podiatrists, their employers and \nservice users in realising such benefits through developments in the statutory \nregistration process. \n\nCatherine Clune Mulvaney \n\nChairperson Podiatrists Registration Board \n\n16 February 2021 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f4 [64] \n\nContents \n\nForeword \n\nAbout the Code \n\nSummary of responsibilities \n\nConduct \n\nPerformance \n\nEthics \n\nAppendix A - Suggested procedure for decision-making \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[64] 5 \n\nAbout the Code \n\nAs a registrant you must comply with this Code of Professional Conduct and \nEthics. \n\nYou must be aware that a breach or breaches of this Code could be held to be \nprofessional misconduct or poor professional performance and could result in a \ndisciplinary sanction being imposed following a fitness to practise inquiry. \n\n“Professional misconduct” as defined by the Health and Social Care \nProfessionals Act 2005 as amended means any act, omission or pattern of \nconduct of the registrant that is a breach of the code of professional conduct and \nethics adopted by the registration board of that profession.1 \n\n“Poor professional performance” as defined by the Health and Social Care \nProfessionals Act 2005 as amended means any failure2 of the registrant to meet \nthe standards of competence that may reasonably be expected of registrants \npractising that profession.3 \n\nComplaints may be made against you under the Health and Social Care \nProfessionals Act 2005 on the following grounds: \n\n• \n\nProfessional misconduct \n\n• \nPoor professional performance \n• A relevant medical disability4 \n\n• A failure to comply with a term or condition of registration or failure to \n\ncomply with an undertaking given \n\n• A contravention of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 or \n\nrules made under it or bye-laws \n\n• A conviction in the State for an offence triable on indictment or a \nconviction outside the State for an offence consisting of acts or omissions \nthat if done or made in the State would constitute an offence triable on \nindictment. \n\nIn this document: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n‘you must’ is used as an overriding principle or duty \n\n‘you must not’ is used as an absolute prohibition \n\n1 Section 50 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. \n2 Failure in the context of poor professional performance has been interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt as a serious failure.
