Relevant Legislation \n\nThis Code of Practice provides practical guidance for employers and \nemployees to assist in meeting existing obligations under the following \nlegislation, the purpose of which is, inter alia, to protect employees from \nworking excessive hours. \n\nThe Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 \n\nThe OWTA 1997 has its genesis in protecting the safety, health and welfare of \nthose at work. The Act does not explicitly refer to a ‘Right to Disconnect’, but \nstates that employers cannot permit employees to work more than a maximum \nof 48 hours per week on average, except in very limited circumstances. \n\nAs such, employers have a legal responsibility to keep records of employees’ \nhours worked under the OWTA 1997. Employers must ensure that their \nemployees receive specified breaks within the day, as well as their daily and \nweekly rest. Employees must also receive their statutory entitlement to annual \nleave and public holiday. \n\nThe duty to ensure compliance with the OWTA 1997 rests with the employer \nand not the employee. Employees have a responsibility to cooperate with any \nappropriate mechanism introduced by the employer for recording of working \ntime. \n\nThe Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 \n\nThe SHWWA 2005 makes further provision for the safety, health and welfare \nof persons at work. The Act sets out the responsibilities of employers, the self employed, employees and various other parties in relation to safety and health \nat work.

Best Practice Guidance on a Right to Disconnect Policy", "text_raw": "6. Best Practice Guidance on a Right to Disconnect Policy \n\nEmployers should engage proactively with employees and/or their trade union \nor other employees’ representatives as appropriate to develop a Right to \nDisconnect Policy that takes account of the particular needs of the business and \nits workforce. The Policy should take account of health and safety legislation, \nthe employee’s terms and conditions of employment as they relate to working \ntime and the statutory obligations on both employers and employees, with \nparticular emphasis on full compliance. \n\nThe Policy should clearly state that it is about supporting the employee’s Right \nto Disconnect, not about restrictions and blockages to communication models \nwhile recognising that occasionally legitimate reasons arise when it is \nnecessary to contact staff outside of normal working hours. \n\nWhere appropriate, the Policy should recognise that certain businesses and \nroles within those businesses do not always operate on a standard hours basis \nbut in a manner responsive to customer needs where flexibility is required to \nmeet the needs of the business, and as agreed in the employee’s terms of \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[159] 9 \n\nemployment. In this regard, the Policy should recognise that such flexibility \nmay be beneficial also to employees and a Policy should find the appropriate \nbalance in terms of employer and employee outcomes. \n\nThe Policy should communicate to all in a clear and unambiguous manner its \npurpose and method of implementation. This communication must reach all \nlevels of the company, from the most junior staff members to senior managers \nwhose support of the Policy must be articulated clearly. \n\nThe Policy should be equality proofed to avoid unintended negative \nconsequences for any employees. For example, employees with caring \nresponsibilities and some employees with a disability may not be in a position \nto stay connected outside of the working day or may need more f lexibility to \nreconnect. \n\nNormal Working Hours and the Right to Disconnect \n\nThe proliferation of digital communication platforms combined with easily \naccessible technology means that sending or checking emails or messages \noutside of normal working hours has become habitual. \n\nA Right to Disconnect Policy should emphasise that there is an expectation that \nstaff disconnect from work emails, messages, etc., outside of their normal \nworking hours and during annual leave. \n\nThe Policy should allow for occasional legitimate situations when it is \nnecessary to contact staff outside of normal working hours, including but in no \nway limited to ascertaining availability for rosters, to fill in at short notice for a \nsick colleague, where unforeseeable circumstances may arise, where an \nemergency may arise, and/or where business and operational reasons require \ncontact out of normal working hours. \n\nThe Policy should recognise that business and operational needs may dictate \nthat there will be situations which clearly require some out-of-hours working \nby some employees depending on the service being provided, the employee’s \nrole, the needs of customers/clients and the unique requirement of critical \nservices and as agreed in an employee’s terms of employment. \n\nWhere relevant to the business, a right to disconnect policy should address the \nissue of working across global time zones. It should recognise that working \nacross different time zones and international travel may result in colleagues \nconnecting at different times outside of normal working hours to complete their \nobjectives. This does not mean that the recipient needs to respond in the same \ntime period. Clear guidance around disconnecting and expectations for \nresponding to digital communications globally should be provided to all \nemployees. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f10 [159] \n\nThe Policy should recognise that many employees choose and may request to \nwork in a more flexible manner given their work life balance needs, which \nresults in employees proactively requesting to work outside normal working \nhours. However, even in circumstances where an employee is working flexibly \nthe right to be able to maintain clear boundaries between work and leisure \nshould not be compromised. \n\nWhere remote or flexible working is in place, employers should consider if \ntheir usual method of monitoring specified working hours is suitable for remote \nand flexible working. In this context, a time management system to record \nworking and attendance is advisable. \n\nCommunications \n\nTone and sense of urgency in written communications should be proportionate, \nparticularly those sent outside of normal working hours – texts or emails sent \noutside of normal working hours may be easily misinterpreted by the recipient \nas to its urgency. \n\nWhere appropriate, use of measures such as email footers and pop-up messages \nto remind employees, and customers, that there is no requirement to reply to \nemails out of hours and an answer should not be expected e.g., putting an ‘Out \nof Office’ on when finishing work and adding a footer to an email signature \nindicating the sender’s normal hours of work. \n\nThe sender’s message is equally important, and when not urgent the email \nshould state that an immediate response is not expected, or the sender should \nutilise the \"delay send\" options and set it to a specified time on the next closest \nworking day. \n\nThe Policy should stress that emergency communications should only be sent \nduring emergency circumstances – such communications should be the \nexception, not the norm. \n\nRole of the Manager \n\nThe Policy should specify that managers play a central role in the successful \nimplementation of a Right to Disconnect policy and where possible, should be \ngiven appropriate training and support. Managers should respect the Right to \nDisconnect of their team members and should demonstrate clear commitment \nto the Policy through leadership and being active role models in this respect. \n\nTraining of managers and staff, where appropriate, should specifically address \nthe ‘Right to Disconnect’, including that this is a mutual right where open \nchannels of communication in relation to workload and time management are \nencouraged, actively managed and any necessary behavioural changes (of \nmanagers/staff) identified. Training and related communications should \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[159] 11 \n\nreinforce the appropriate behaviours around disconnecting from work outside \nnormal working hours. \n\nManagers must also recognise and take action when an employee’s inability or \nreluctance to disconnect appears to be linked to excessive workload, \nperformance issues, or whether organisational culture is a contributing f actor. \nIn such circumstances, managers must ensure that employees have clear goals \nand deliverables that, other than in exceptional circumstances, stand to be \ndelivered during normal working hours. \n\nCulture and Oversight \n\nOrganisational culture and leadership play a key role in tempering customer \nexpectations in respect of receiving responses outside of normal office hours \nalbeit due to business and operational needs, communications are occasionally \nrequired outside of employee’s normal working hours. \n\nThe Right to Disconnect Policy should not only be referenced in an employee’s \nterms and conditions of employment or employment contract as with any other \ncompany policy but also should be read in conjunction with the organisation’s \nDignity at Work, E-communications, Data Protection and Confidentiality \nPolicies. The Policy should be emphasised during any induction process. \n\nSome workplaces may, where possible, wish to establish a monitoring \ncommittee to oversee the implementation of the Policy or assign responsibility \nto a HR staff member. In any event the effectiveness of the Policy should be \nreviewed annually in accordance with company practice and, where \nappropriate, in consultation with trade union or other employee representatives \nas appropriate. \n\nWellbeing \n\nWorkplace policies on the Right to Disconnect sit fully within the broader \nobjective of ensuring employee wellbeing, health and safety and the Policy \nshould reflect this.", "text_norm": "6 best practice guidance right disconnect policy employer engage proactively employee trade union employee representative appropriate develop right disconnect policy take account particular need business workforce policy take account health safety legislation employee term condition employment relate working time statutory obligation employer employee particular emphasis full compliance policy clearly state supporting employee right disconnect restriction blockage communication model recognising occasionally legitimate reason arise necessary contact staff outside normal working hour appropriate policy recognise certain business role within business always operate standard hour basis manner responsive customer need flexibility required meet need business agreed employee term 159 9 employment regard policy recognise flexibility may beneficial also employee policy find appropriate balance term employer employee outcome policy communicate clear unambiguous manner purpose method implementation communication must reach level company junior staff member senior manager whose support policy must articulated clearly policy equality proofed avoid unintended negative consequence employee example employee caring responsibility employee disability may position stay connected outside working day may need f lexibility reconnect normal working hour right disconnect proliferation digital communication platform combined easily accessible technology mean sending checking email message outside normal working hour become habitual right disconnect policy emphasise expectation staff disconnect work email message etc outside normal working hour annual leave policy allow occasional legitimate situation necessary contact staff outside normal working hour including way limited ascertaining availability roster fill short notice sick colleague unforeseeable circumstance may arise emergency may arise business operational reason require contact normal working hour policy recognise business operational need may dictate situation clearly require out-of-hours working employee depending service provided employee role need customer client unique requirement critical service agreed employee term employment relevant business right disconnect policy address issue working across global time zone recognise working across different time zone international travel may result colleague connecting different time outside normal working hour complete objective mean recipient need respond time period clear guidance around disconnecting expectation responding digital communication globally provided employee 10 159 policy recognise many employee choose may request work flexible manner given work life balance need result employee proactively requesting work outside normal working hour however even circumstance employee working flexibly right able maintain clear boundary work leisure compromised remote flexible working place employer consider usual method monitoring specified working hour suitable remote flexible working context time management system record working attendance advisable communication tone sense urgency written communication proportionate particularly sent outside normal working hour -

Raising Concerns \n\nEmployees and employers should manage the Right to Disconnect in a manner \nthat is respectful of the other’s rights and expectations and in the context of the \nrelevant legislation and good workplace relations generally. They should also \nbe conscious of the fact that due to business and operational needs and \ndepending on a number of factors, including the role of the employee, \ncustomer/client needs, nature of the business, global reach of the employer, that \ncircumstances may occasionally arise that necessitate that communications are \nsent and received outside of employees’ normal working hours. When \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f12 [159] \n\noccasional contact outside normal working hours becomes the norm, this needs \nto be addressed. \n\nIn this regard, situations may arise where an employee may feel that their right \nto disconnect is not being respected or that their workload is such that they are \nnot able to disconnect at the end of their normal working day. Examples of \nsuch situations might include: \n\n• Being contacted regularly outside of normal work hours. \n\n• Being regularly expected to work additional unpaid hours. \n\n• Being expected to regularly work through lunch or other breaks. \n\n• Being penalised for not being available out of normal working hours or \nfavourable treatment for employees who stay connected out of hours. \n\nMost employees who find themselves in this situation will want this level of \nintrusion to stop. \n\nBest practice suggests that employees should attempt to resolve the problem \nwith the person(s) informally in the first instance. In circumstances where an \nemployee feels that it would be too difficult to do this on their own, an \nalternative approach would be to seek support from, or for an initial approach \nto be made by their manager, a member of human resources (HR), a trusted \ncolleague or designated person or trade union representative. \n\nLarger organisations with discrete HR units could consider appointing a \ndesignated member of the HR team to be the point of contact to assist in \ndirecting resources to resolve any matters raised under the Policy. \n\nIf an informal process has not been successful in resolving the issue, then the \nformal company grievance procedure may be utilised.

Sample Right to Disconnect Policy Layout and Template Clauses \n\nBased on the best practice set out above a Right to Disconnect Policy could \nfollow the generic layout below and should be tailored to meet the individual \nneeds of each organisation. \n\na. Introduction \n\nThe introduction should set out the purpose of the Policy with a statement \ntailored to meet individual workplaces. \n\nb. Wellbeing \n\nWellbeing may be addressed in other company policies and these can be \nreferenced as appropriate, otherwise the Policy should emphasise that the Right \nto Disconnect sits within the broader objective of ensuring the safety, health \nand wellbeing of employees. \n\nc. Obligations on Employers and Employees \n\nThe Policy should stress that a joint effort will be required to implement the \nPolicy and remind both employers and employees of their statutory obligations. \n\na. Employer Obligations… \n\nb. Employee obligations… \n\nd. The Role of Managers \n\nGiven that line managers will have close interaction with employees, their role \nin ensuring that employees are able to disconnect from work should be clearly \nset out. \n\ne. Working Hours \n\nThe Policy should address the issue of working hours given that ‘normal \nworking hours’ may be very different for employees even within the same \norganisation, i.e., while some may work a more traditional hourly pattern (f or \nexample, 9 to 5) and others may work flexibly or have varying working time \npatterns, the Policy must explicitly state that all have the right to disconnect in \nline with the Policy. \n\nf. Communications \n\nThe workplace’s policy in relation to communications should be set out and \nshould emphasise that employees personal time is respected and that there is a \ngeneral expectation that employees disconnect from work e-mails and \ncommunications outside of normal working hours. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f14 [159] \n\ng. Meetings \n\nThe Policy should set out the workplace’s policy in relation to scheduling and \nattendance at meetings. \n\nh. Raising Concerns \n\nThe Policy should set out the procedure for raising concerns, informally and \nformally, in relation to the Right to Disconnect. \n\nTemplate Policy Content \n\nA Right to Disconnect Policy may open by stating the intention and purpose of \nthe Policy and include a positive statement along the following lines. \n\nIntroduction \n\n‘The health and wellbeing of our employees is of the utmost importance to us \nand we encourage and support our employees to prioritise their own \nwellbeing. \n\nDisconnecting from work is vital for your wellbeing, and to help you achieve \na healthy and sustainable work-life balance. The organisation recognises \nthat every employee is entitled to switch off outside of their normal working \nhours and enjoy their free time away from work without being disturbed, \nunless there is an emergency or agreement to do so, for example while ‘on \ncall’. \n\nThis company recognises that, where appropriate, flexible working \narrangements can facilitate employees in meeting personal and family \ncommitments and assist in maintaining a positive work life balance. \n\nEqually, as an employer we recognise that flexible working arrangements \nundertaken by employees can assist in meeting our business needs. Where \nflexible working arrangements are in place, it can be beneficial for both \nemployees and employers. However, as an employer we are conscious that an \n‘always on’ working environment can bring additional challenges and risks \nfor our employees. \n\nTo encourage and support our employees in balancing their working and \npersonal lives whether they work traditional hours in the workplace, work \nremotely or flexibly we have adopted a ‘Right to Disconnect’ company policy, \nwhich includes best practice guidance around wellbeing, working hours, the \nuse of technology and more. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[159] 15 \n\nTemplate Wellbeing Clauses \n\nEmployees working from home are encouraged to schedule post-work leisure \nactivity, in order to create some separation from the end of their workday and \nthe beginning of their personal time. \n\nStaff, including those engaging in flexible working arrangements or remote \nworking are reminded to switch off from work, to monitor their working \nhours and to take breaks in accordance with the Organisation of Working \nTime Act 1997 (OWTA 1997), away from work devices. Staff must take \nreasonable care of their health and safety in accordance with section 13 of \nthe Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (SHWWA 2005). \n\nTemplate Communications Clauses \n\nWhere possible, e-mails should be checked or sent only during normal \nworking hours. \n\nDue to differing/non-standard patterns of work in the organisation, some \nemployees may send communications at times which are inopportune for \nother employees, e.g., weekends. The sender should give due consideration to \nthe timing of their communication and potential for disturbance, and the \nrecipient should understand that they will not be expected to respond until \ntheir working time recommences. \n\nEmployees should not feel that they must respond to social communications \nfrom colleagues outside of their working hours, and the Policy should state \nwhether or not social media platforms are acceptable means of work-related \ncommunication in that particular workplace. \n\nWhere a manager sends communications outside agreed working hours, \nunless business and operational needs dictate that an immediate response is \nrequired, a statement will be attached to an out of hours email tempering the \nexpectation of an immediate response. \n\nManagers should speak to a team member if they notice that they are sending \nemails at odd hours or logging in excessively – this may be a sign that they \nare finding it difficult to manage their workload or ‘switch-off’. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f16 [159] \n\nTemplate Email Out of Office and Footers \n\n“My normal working hours are from X to Y.

Employees should be \nmindful of and manage how much virtual communication they have each \nday. \n\nWhile meetings are crucial to strengthen connections between individuals \nand teams, the frequency and timing of meetings should be continuously \nreviewed to ensure optimum use of time and allow colleagues time to work \noutside of meetings. \n\nMeetings should be scheduled during normal working hours, avoiding \nlunchtime where possible.", "text_norm": "8 sample right disconnect policy layout template clause based best practice set right disconnect policy could follow generic layout tailored meet individual need organisation a introduction introduction set purpose policy statement tailored meet individual workplace b wellbeing wellbeing may addressed company policy referenced appropriate otherwise policy emphasise right disconnect sits within broader objective ensuring safety health wellbeing employee c obligation employer employee policy stress joint effort required implement policy remind employer employee statutory obligation a employer obligation b employee obligation d role manager given line manager close interaction employee role ensuring employee able disconnect work clearly set out e working hour policy address issue working hour given normal working hour may different employee even within organisation i.e may work traditional hourly pattern (f example 9 5) others may work flexibly varying working time pattern policy must explicitly state right disconnect line policy f communication workplace policy relation communication set emphasise employee personal time respected general expectation employee disconnect work e-mail communication outside normal working hour 14 159 g meeting policy set workplace policy relation scheduling attendance meeting h raising concern policy set procedure raising concern informally formally relation right disconnect template policy content right disconnect policy may open stating intention purpose policy include positive statement along following line introduction health wellbeing employee utmost importance u encourage support employee prioritise wellbeing disconnecting work vital wellbeing help achieve healthy sustainable work-life balance organisation recognises every employee entitled switch outside normal working hour enjoy free time away work without disturbed unless emergency agreement example call  company recognises appropriate flexible working arrangement facilitate employee meeting personal family commitment assist maintaining positive work life balance equally employer recognise flexible working arrangement undertaken employee assist meeting business need flexible working arrangement place beneficial employee employer however employer conscious always working environment bring additional challenge risk employee encourage support employee balancing working personal life whether work traditional hour workplace work remotely flexibly adopted right disconnect company policy includes best practice guidance around wellbeing working hour use technology more 159 15 template wellbeing clause employee working home encouraged schedule post-work leisure activity order create separation end workday beginning personal time staff including engaging flexible working arrangement remote working reminded switch work monitor working hour take break accordance organisation working time act 1997 (owta 1997) away work device staff must take reasonable care health safety accordance section 13 safety health welfare work act 2005 (shwwa 2005) template communication clause possible e-mail checked sent normal working hour due differing non-standard pattern work organisation employee may send communication time inopportune employee e.g weekend sender give due consideration timing communication potential disturbance recipient understand expected respond working time recommences employee feel must respond social communication colleague outside working hour policy state whether social medium platform acceptable mean work-related communication particular workplace manager sends communication outside agreed working hour unless business operational need dictate immediate response required statement attached hour email tempering expectation immediate response manager speak team member notice sending email odd hour logging excessively -
