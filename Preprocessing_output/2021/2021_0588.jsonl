This licence regime falls under the EPA Act, 1992 as amended \nand its associated regulations. The IPPC licence was replaced with the \nIndustrial Emissions (IED) Licence and the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) \nLicence. \n\nThe regulations make one amendment to the declaration on the application \nform to provide for a valid declaration where the application is made in \nelectronic form. In circumstances where a hand written signature is not \npossible such as where an application is made online vie the ePlanning portal \nthen valid login credentials will meet the requirement of the declaration. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f6 [588] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€3.00 \n\n(PPS-18) 75. 11/21.
