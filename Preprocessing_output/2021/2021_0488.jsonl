The design features of the marks remain \nunchanged from the 2008 Regulations (S.I. No. 296 of 2008) which are \nrevoked and replaced. \n\nThe Regulations provide that stamps may be made from hard metal (to which \nmarks may be embossed in relief or engraved), or specially produced tamperevident paper labels or tamper-evident plastic seals onto which marks can be \nprinted. New methods of control are established to ensure security and \ntraceability for the issue and use of the printed stamps as has been practice for \nhard metal stamps. The requirements for acceptable sealing and securing \narrangements are prescribed. \n\nThese Regulations come into effect on 1 October 2021. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f10 [488] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€ 3.00 \n\n(BSU-2) 75. 9/21.
