Measuring and Monitoring Outdoor Coverage Compliance", "text_raw": "3. Measuring and Monitoring Outdoor Coverage Compliance \n\n(1) For the purpose of determining compliance with the above outdoor \ncoverage obligations, the Commission will measure and monitor the outdoor \ncoverage obligations based on the following principles: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nthe Commission’s radio network planning tools, supported by \nfield measurements which may include drive tests where \nappropriate, will be the key component in assessing compliance \nwith the coverage obligations; \n\nall rights of use available to the Licensee can be used to contribute \nto meeting the coverage obligations; \n\nthe Commission will use an RSRP metric for LTE as a proxy for \ndetermining the Licensee’s compliance with the coverage levels; \n\nthe Commission acknowledges that while newer technologies \nwill be rolled out over time, LTE technology is expected to \ncontinue to be used by operators in delivering data to consumers \nfor some time; \n\nthe obligations are set to incentivise operators to rollout new sites \nas appropriate, upgrade sites with additional spectrum and make \nuse of improvements in technology such as new standards \nincluding carrier aggregation and carrier sharing or extension \ntechniques; \n\n(f) \n\ndepending how the above techniques are deployed on a network, \nthis will yield varying benefits in terms of increasing the range of \na cell for a given throughput; \n\n(g) where carrier aggregation is deployed using carriers with similar \npropagation characteristics (e.g. carriers in the 700 MHz Duplex, \n800 MHz Band and 900 MHz Band), the additional bandwidth \nand resultant throughput gains will be available, to a large extent, \nfor the whole of the cell range; \n\n(h) where bands with different propagation characteristics are carrier \naggregated, the throughput enhancements will be considered over \nthe range of the highest of the frequency bands; \n\n32 E.g. mobile virtual network operators (“MVNOs”) \n\n \n \n \n \n\f[264] 31 \n\n(i) \n\nan RSRP base level of -103 dBm will be used as a proxy for 30 \nMbit/s SUTP using a 10 MHz downlink carrier. Where capacity \nincreasing techniques are used such as carrier aggregation or \ndeployment of additional bandwidth, or both, a lower RSRP value \ncan be used as follows: \n\ni. where additional 10 MHz downlink carriers are added \nusing two or three band carrier aggregation across \nbands with similar propagation characteristics (e.g. \ncarriers in the 700 MHz Duplex, 800 MHz Band and \n900 MHz Band) RSRP levels of -108 dBm and -113 \ndBm will apply respectively; \n\n(j) \n\nan RSRP base level of -112 dBm be used as a proxy for 3 Mbit/s \nSUTP using a 10 MHz downlink carrier. Where capacity \nincreasing techniques are used such as carrier aggregation or \ndeployment of additional bandwidth, or both, a lower RSRP value \nwill be used as follows: \n\ni. where additional 10 MHz downlink carriers are added \nusing two or three band carrier aggregation across \nbands with similar propagation characteristics (e.g. \ncarriers in the 700 MHz Duplex, 800 MHz Band and \n900 MHz Band) RSRP levels of -114 dBm and -116 \ndBm will apply respectively; \n\n(k) noting that there may be many different potential combinations of \nspectrum and deployment techniques that could be used by a New \nEntrant, the Commission will apply the same principles as \nidentified above in determining the appropriate approach to \nmeasuring and monitoring the coverage obligations; and \n\n(l) \n\nas new technologies or coverage enhancing techniques are rolled \nout, the Commission will consider proposals from Licensees as to \nhow this could influence meeting the coverage obligations, \nfollowing which the Commission may determine additional \nmetrics and base levels as a proxy for determining the Licensee’s \ncompliance with the coverage levels. \n\n(2) The Commission will identify a population file for the purposes of \nmeasuring and monitoring the population coverage obligation by using the \nmost up to date and appropriate datasets available at the time of conducting \nthe measurement which, at this juncture, the Commission envisages to \nconsist of: \n\n(a) generating the population dataset by combining information from \n\nthe CSO and the Eircode datasets; and \n\n(b) using the residential addresses in the Eircode database to \ndetermine the geographic coordinates of the residential locations \nand the population statistics for the small areas dataset as \nprovided by the CSO. \n\n(3) In the absence of manifest error, the population file used by the \nCommission will be definitive in assessing compliance with the obligation. \n\n \n\f32 [264]", "text_norm": "3 measuring monitoring outdoor coverage compliance (1) purpose determining compliance outdoor coverage obligation commission measure monitor outdoor coverage obligation based following principle (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) commission radio network planning tool supported field measurement may include drive test appropriate key component assessing compliance coverage obligation right use available licensee used contribute meeting coverage obligation commission use rsrp metric lte proxy determining licensee compliance coverage level commission acknowledges newer technology rolled time lte technology expected continue used operator delivering data consumer time obligation set incentivise operator rollout new site appropriate upgrade site additional spectrum make use improvement technology new standard including carrier aggregation carrier sharing extension technique (f) depending technique deployed network yield varying benefit term increasing range cell given throughput (g) carrier aggregation deployed using carrier similar propagation characteristic (e.g carrier 700 mhz duplex 800 mhz band 900 mhz band) additional bandwidth resultant throughput gain available large extent whole cell range (h) band different propagation characteristic carrier aggregated throughput enhancement considered range highest frequency band 32 e.g mobile virtual network operator ( mvnos ) 264 31 (i) rsrp base level -103 dbm used proxy 30 mbit sutp using 10 mhz downlink carrier capacity increasing technique used carrier aggregation deployment additional bandwidth lower rsrp value used follows i additional 10 mhz downlink carrier added using two three band carrier aggregation across band similar propagation characteristic (e.g carrier 700 mhz duplex 800 mhz band 900 mhz band) rsrp level -108 dbm -113 dbm apply respectively (j) rsrp base level -112 dbm used proxy 3 mbit sutp using 10 mhz downlink carrier capacity increasing technique used carrier aggregation deployment additional bandwidth lower rsrp value used follows i additional 10 mhz downlink carrier added using two three band carrier aggregation across band similar propagation characteristic (e.g carrier 700 mhz duplex 800 mhz band 900 mhz band) rsrp level -114 dbm -116 dbm apply respectively (k) noting may many different potential combination spectrum deployment technique could used new entrant commission apply principle identified determining appropriate approach measuring monitoring coverage obligation (l) new technology coverage enhancing technique rolled commission consider proposal licensee could influence meeting coverage obligation following commission may determine additional metric base level proxy determining licensee compliance coverage level (2) commission identify population file purpose measuring monitoring population coverage obligation using date appropriate datasets available time conducting measurement juncture commission envisages consist (a) generating population dataset combining information cso eircode datasets (b) using residential address eircode database determine geographic coordinate residential location population statistic small area dataset provided cso (3) absence manifest error population file used commission definitive assessing compliance obligation 32 264", "start_char": 63862, "end_char": 68427, "source_path": "downloads\\2021\\2021_0264.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "checksum": "sha256:4bf416d0d43fb75138044e742e08dd1453c599fc33d85fdd9e70cd24e324308d", "cross_refs": []}
