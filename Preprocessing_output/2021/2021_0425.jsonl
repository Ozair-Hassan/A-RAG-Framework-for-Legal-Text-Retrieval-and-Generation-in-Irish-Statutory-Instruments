The applicant must also propose a \nminimum length of time over which the designation will apply (the “minimum \ncost rental period”), which must be at least as long as the cost calculation period. \n\nThe assessment process serves to interrogate the proposed starting rent by \nverifying that the costs proposed are accurate and appropriate, and that the \nproposed rent is no higher than is required under the cash-flow model over the \ncost calculation period. The detail of the financial data and information that is \nrequired from the applicant is set out in the Regulations, with individual items \nspecified in Schedule 1. An application cannot be formally submitted in advance \nof the applicant gaining title over the property. \n\nIn addition to the specific data that is required, a range of supporting material is \nrequired (Regulations 7 and 12). A number of declarations are also required, \nincluding from the applicant that the information provided is accurate (Part 2 of \nSchedule 2) and from the holder of any interest, estate, or incumbrance that they \nconsent to the Cost Rental designation (Schedule 4). \n\nThe final step in the designation process is the completion of the Cost Rental \nDesignation Document (Schedule 3), which specifies the terms on which a \ndwelling is to be designated. This document is submitted to the applicant for \ntheir formal written assent, before being returned for the application of the \nMinister’s seal, at which point the designation is complete. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f14 [425] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \n52 FAICHE STIABHNA, BAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 2, \nD02 DR67. \n\nTeil: 076 110 6834 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \n52 ST.
