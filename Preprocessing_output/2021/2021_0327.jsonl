Regulations 4 to 30 amend sections 2, 5, 6, \n30, 32A, 33, 34, 66, 74, 76, 91A, 91B, 91C, 91D, 91E, 91F, 101, 102, 111, 115, \n116, 120, Schedule 2 and Schedule 9 of the Act, and insert the new sections 35A, \n91G, 91H, 91I, 91J and 91K into the Act. These amendments will come into \nforce from 1 July 2021. \n\nAn explanation of the Regulations is set out below. \n\nRegulation 1 gives the citation and title of the Regulations. \n\nRegulation 2 sets out the date of coming into effect of the Regulations. \n\nRegulation 3 defines, for the purposes of these Regulations, the Act of 2010 as \nmeaning the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010. \n\nRegulation 4 amends section 2 of the Act by inserting the new definitions \n“intra-Community distance sales of goods” and “distance sales of goods \nimported from third territories or third countries”. \n\nRegulation 5 contains a consequential amendment to section 5(1) of the Act to \ninsert a reference to section 91J(10). \n\nRegulation 6 includes a consequential amendment to section 6 of the Act which \nis required as a result of the changes made to section 30 in Regulation 7 below. \n\nRegulation 7 substitutes a new section in place of the existing section 30. \nSection 30 sets out the place of supply rules for intra-Community distance sales \n\n20 OJ No. L348, 29.12.2017, p. 7 \n21 OJ No. L 244, 29.7.2020, p. 3 \n22 OJ No. L 310, 2.12.2019, p. 1 \n23 OJ No. L244, 29.7.2020, p. 3 \n24 OJ No. L311, 7.12.2018, p. 3. \n\n \n \n \n \n\f[327] 35 \n\nof goods and distance sales of goods imported from third territories and third \ncountries. \n\nRegulation 8 amends section 32A of the Act, which relates to chain transactions, \nand provides that where a deemed supplier is the supplier of goods, it is not \npossible for the provision relating to chain transactions to apply to that supply. \n\nRegulation 9 amends section 33 by the deletion of subsection (4B). It is a \nconsequential amendment required as a result of the deletion of paragraph (kd) \nin section 34 by Regulation 10 below. \n\nRegulation 10 contains an amendment of section 34. Paragraph (kd) of that \nsection is deleted, while paragraph (kc) is amended to replace the reference to \nparagraph (kd) in that paragraph with a reference to section 35A, as inserted by \nRegulation 11. \n\nRegulation 11 amends Part 4 of the Act by inserting a new Chapter 4, which \ncontains a new section 35A. Section 35A sets out place of supply rules for some \nsuppliers who make supplies of intra-Community distance sales of goods and \nsupplies of telecommunication services, radio or television broadcasting services \nor electronically supplied services (TBE services). \n\nSubsections (1) and (2) provide that a supplier who makes such supplies \nfrom the State to non-taxable persons resident in other Member States, \nand the value of the goods and services supplied in one year is less than \nthe threshold of €10,000, section 29(1)(a) will apply to the intraCommunity distance sales of goods, and section 34(b) will apply to the \nsupply of TBE services. This means that the place of supply rules which \nwill apply are those which would apply to a domestic supply of goods \nand services, and as such the VAT due on those supplies will be \naccounted for in the State. \n\nSubsection (3) of that section provides that where the €10,000 is \nexceeded in a calendar year, the place of supply rules contained in \nsections 30(a) and section 34(kc) will apply to those sales from the date \non which the threshold is exceeded. \n\nSubsection (4)(a) provides that a person who has not exceeded the \n€10,000 threshold may opt for the place of supply rules contained in \nsection 30(a) and section 34(kc) to apply to sales which he or she makes. \nWhere a person opts for those sections to apply to intra-Community \ndistance sales of goods or supplies of TBE services which he or she \nmakes, subsection (4)(b) provides that such a decision will apply for a \nperiod not less than 2 years from the date on which the option is \nexercised. \n\nRegulation 12 amends section 66(1)(a)(ii) to provide that a taxable person must \nissue an invoice where a supply is deemed to have taken place in another \nMember State, except where the Union scheme is used to declare and pay the \nVAT due on the goods. \n\nRegulation 13 amends section 74(1) to specify that the time at which payment \nis accepted is the time at which tax is chargeable where a supply of goods is \nmade by an electronic interface who is the deemed supplier of the goods under \nsection 91G. \n\n \n\f36 [327] \n\nRegulation 14 amends section 76(1) to include a reference to section 91K(3) in \nthat subsection. \n\nRegulation 15 inserts a new title for Chapter 2 of Part 10 of the Act. \n\nRegulation 16 amends a number of definitions contained in section 91A, and \nalso inserts a number of new definitions into that section. \n\nThe definitions “Implementing Regulation”, “Member State of \nconsumption”, “Member State of identification”, “non-Union scheme”, \n“scheme services”, “Union scheme” and “VAT return” have been \namended in order to provide for the increased scope of the OSS and the \nintroduction of the Import Scheme, the deeming of electronic interfaces \nand the Special Arrangements for VAT on Import. \n\nThe definitions “import scheme”, “intrinsic value”, “qualifying \ndomestic supply of goods”, “taxable person not established in the \nCommunity” and “taxable person not established in the Member State of \nConsumption” are also inserted by this regulation. These definitions \napply to all of Chapter 2 of Part 10 of the Act. \n\nRegulation 17 amends section 91B, where the State is the Member State of \nidentification for the non-Union scheme, to provide for the increased scope of \nthe non-Union scheme within the One Stop Shop. \n\nParagraph (a) amends subsection (1)(b)(i) to allow for the use of the nonUnion scheme in the State and the Union scheme in another Member \nState. \n\nParagraph (b) amends subsection 7(a) to set out the new date by which \nreturns are required to be made. It is also amended by changing a \nreference from section 34(kc) to the relevant chapters of the Act. \n\nParagraph (c) inserts a new subsection (10A) which sets out the rules \npertaining to deductibility where a person makes use of the non-Union \nscheme. \n\nParagraph (d) substitutes a new subsection (11). This substituted \nsubsection sets out the conditions under which corrections to a previously \nmade VAT return may be submitted and what information this correction \nis to contain. \n\nRegulation 18 amends section 91C, where the State is the Member State to \nwhich supplies of services is made under the non-Union Scheme. \n\nParagraph (a) contains a consequential amendment to subsection (1) to \nreflect the amendment made to section 34 and associated insertion of \nChapter 3 of Part 4. \n\nParagraphs (b) and (c) amend the dates contained in subsections (3) and \n(4) respectively. \n\nParagraph (d) amends subsection (6)(b) to set out the rules relating to \ndeductibility for a supplier making supplies to the State. \n\nRegulation 19 amends section 91D, where the State is the Member State of \nidentification for the Union scheme, to provide for the extended scope of the \nUnion scheme within the One Stop Shop. \n\n \n\f[327] 37 \n\nParagraph (a) amends subsection (1) to provide for the persons who may \nuse the Union scheme, and to allow for the use of the non-Union scheme \nand the Union scheme simultaneously. \n\nParagraph (b) amends subsection (3) to provide that the date on which \nsupplies under the Union scheme have commenced must be provided to \nthe Revenue Commissioners. \n\nParagraph (c) amends subsection (4) by inserting new paragraphs (c) and \n(d) to provide that where a taxable person chooses the State as the \nMember State of Identification, that decision has effect for the remainder \nof the year in question and a further period of 2 years. \n\nParagraph (d) amends subsection (7) to provide that a taxable person \nregistered for the Union scheme must submit a VAT return by the end of \nthe month following a calendar quarter, and remit the VAT due on \nsupplies made under the scheme. A VAT return must be made even if no \nsupplies have been made during that quarter. \n\nParagraph (e) amends subsection (8) to provide that the VAT return made \nunder subsection (7) must be made in euro and sets out the details of what \nis to be included in the VAT return. \n\nParagraph (f) amends subsection (11) to set out the conditions under \nwhich corrections to a previously made VAT return may be submitted \nand what information this correction is to contain. \n\nRegulation 20 amends section 91E, where Ireland is the Member State of \nconsumption for the purposes of the Union scheme. The amendments contained \nin paragraphs (a) to (f) are required in order to account for the increase scope of \ntransactions which may be declared using the Union scheme and to reflect the \nchange of dates on which returns and remittances are to be made under the Union \nscheme. \n\nRegulation 21 amends section 91F to provide that regulations may be made in \nrelation to the Union scheme and the non-Union scheme, as well as the Special \nArrangements, the Import Scheme and the deeming provision for electronic \ninterfaces. \n\nRegulation 22 inserts sections 91G, 91H, 91I, 91J and 91K into the Act. \n\nSection 91G transposes the provisions of the Directive relating to the deeming \nof electronic interfaces to be the suppliers of goods in certain circumstances. \n\nSubsection (1) describes the circumstances in which an electronic \ninterface will be the deemed supplier of goods imported into the EU \n(paragraph (a)) and goods that are in free circulation within the EU and \nthe underlying supplier of the goods is not established in the EU \n(paragraph (b)). \n\nSubsection (2) provides that the transport of goods where an electronic \ninterface is deemed to have supplied goods is ascribed to the supply made \nby the deemed supplier. \n\nSubsection (3) sets out the record keeping responsibilities of a deemed \n\nsupplier, \n\n \n\f38 [327] \n\nSubsection (4) sets out the record keeping responsibilities of an \nelectronic interface who facilitates the sale of goods and services. These \nrecord keeping responsibilities apply even where an electronic interface \nis not the deemed supplier of goods. The records must be sufficiently \ndetailed to enable VAT to be verified, must be made available to the \nRevenue Commissioners and Member States in which the transactions \nare taxable on request, and must be retained for a period of 10 years from \n31 December of the year in which the transaction was carried out. \n\nSection 91H transposes the provisions of the Directive relating to the Special \nArrangements for VAT on Import. \n\nSubsection (1) defines the Special Arrangements for the purposes of the \nsection. \n\nSubsection (2) sets out the circumstances in which the Special \nArrangements may be used. \n\nSubsection (3) contains the conditions which must be fulfilled by a \ntaxable person in order to use the special arrangements. \n\nSubsection (4)(a) provides that where the Special Arrangements are used, \nthe person to whom the goods are destined remains liable for the VAT \ndue. Subsection (4)(b) also provides that the person using the Special \nArrangements is to collect and pay the VAT due to the Revenue \nCommissioners. \n\nSubsection (5) specifies that where goods are declared through the \nSpecial Arrangements, the VAT rate which will apply is the standard rate \nof VAT. This is regardless of the rate of VAT which would otherwise \napply to the goods. \n\nSubsection (6) sets out the manner in which information is to be provided \nto the Revenue Commissioners by a user of the Special Arrangements \neach month. \n\nSubsection (7) specifies the information to be contained in a declaration \nmade to the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of the Special \nArrangements. \n\nSubsection (8) contains the record keeping obligations which a user of \nthe Special Arrangements must fulfil. \n\nSection 91I contains interpretation and general provisions relating to the Import \nScheme contained in the eCommerce Package. \n\nSubsection (1) defines the terms “intermediary”, “Member State of \nconsumption”, “Member State of identification” and “VAT return” for \nthe purposes of the Import Scheme as contained in sections 91I, 91J and \n91K of the Act. \n\nSubsection (2) provides that if a taxable person or an intermediary acting \non behalf of a taxable person has more than one fixed establishment in \nthe Community, the decision in respect of the Member State of \nidentification which that taxable person or intermediary makes for the \npurposes of the Import Scheme has effect for the remainder of the year \nconcerned and an additional period of 2 years. \n\n \n\f[327] 39 \n\nSubsection (3) sets out the goods to which the Import Scheme may apply. \n\nSubsection (4) details the taxable persons who may use the Import \nScheme, and whether a taxable person must appoint an intermediary in \norder to use the Import Scheme. \n\nSubsection (5) provides that where a person uses the Import Scheme, it \nmust be used to declare all supplies which are within scope of the Import \nScheme. \n\nSubsection (6) states that a person may not appoint more than one \nintermediary at any one time. \n\nSubsection (7) holds that where goods are supplied under the Import \nScheme, goods are regarded as having been supplied at the time payment \nis accepted. VAT is then chargeable at the time of the supply. \n\nSection 91J sets out how the Import Scheme operates where the State is the \nMember State of identification for the purposes of the scheme. \n\nSubsection (1) provides that where a person or an intermediary acting on \nbehalf of a person must notify the Revenue Commissioners where \nactivity commences under the Import Scheme, or where activity changes \nsuch that the person or the intermediary no longer meets the conditions \nassociated with using the Import Scheme. \n\nSubsection (2) holds that a person may not be registered in the State for \nthe purposes of the Import Scheme if that person is registered for the \nscheme in another Member State or that person has been excluded from \nthe scheme. \n\nSubsection (3) obliges the Revenue Commissioners to create an import \nscheme identification register for the Import Scheme. This register will \nbe used in order to record persons identified in the State for the purposes \nof the scheme. \n\nSubsection (4) sets out the information a taxable person not using an \nintermediary is to provide the Revenue Commissioners before that \nperson commences use of the Import Scheme. \n\nSubsection (5) sets out the information a person seeking to become an \nintermediary is to provide the Revenue Commissioners before that \nperson commences use of the Import Scheme on behalf of a taxable \nperson. \n\nSubsection (6) sets out the information an intermediary is to provide the \nRevenue Commissioners on behalf of a taxable person before that taxable \nperson commences use of the Import Scheme. \n\nSubsection (7) mandates that a taxable person or an intermediary acting \non his or her behalf must notify the Revenue Commissioners of any \nchanges in the information provided under subsections (4) to (6). \n\nSubsection (8) sets out the process which will be followed where a \ntaxable person (paragraph (a)) or an intermediary acting on behalf of a \ntaxable person (paragraph (b)) submits the information required under \nsubsections (4) to (6) (as appropriate) to the Revenue Commissioners. \n\n \n\f40 [327] \n\nWhere the information is received, the taxable person or intermediary \nwill be registered on the import scheme identification register, be \nallocated an identification number and be notified of the number and the \ndate on which the registration will go live. An intermediary will be \nallocated an identification number in respect of each taxable person \nwhich he or she represents. \n\nParagraph (c) specifies that an identification number issued can only be \nused for the purposes of the Import Scheme. \n\nSubsection (9) sets out the circumstances in which a taxable person or an \nintermediary will be removed from the identification register for the \nImport Scheme. \n\nUnder paragraph (a), a taxable person who does not use an intermediary \nwill be removed from the register where: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nthe Revenue Commissioners are notified that supplies under the \nImport Scheme are no longer made, \n\nthe taxable person no longer meets the conditions associated with \nthe Import Scheme, \n\nthe taxable person persistently fails to comply with the rules of \nthe scheme, or \n\nthe Revenue Commissioners can assume the taxable person’s \nsupplies have ceased. \n\nUnder paragraph (b), an intermediary will be removed from the register \nwhere: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nthe intermediary has not acted on behalf of a taxable person for \ntwo consecutive calendar quarters, \n\nthe intermediary no longer meets the conditions associated with \nacting as an intermediary, or \n\nthe intermediary persistently fails to comply with the rules of the \nscheme, \n\nUnder paragraph (c), a taxable person who uses an intermediary will be \nremoved from the register where: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nthe Revenue Commissioners are notified by the intermediary that \nsupplies under the Import Scheme are no longer made, \n\nthe taxable person no longer meets the conditions associated with \nthe Import Scheme, \n\nthe intermediary notifies the Revenue Commissioners that he or \nshe no longer represents the taxable person, \n\nthe taxable person persistently fails to comply with the rules of \nthe scheme, or \n\nthe Revenue Commissioners can assume the taxable person’s \nsupplies have ceased. \n\n \n\f[327] 41 \n\nSubsection (10) provides that the Revenue Commissioners may issue a \nnotice to an intermediary and a taxable person which that intermediary \nrepresents holding that intermediary jointly and severally liable for \nsupplies made under the Import Scheme. The Revenue Commissioners \nmay issue such a notice for the protection of the revenue. \n\nSubsection (11) obliges a taxable person or his or her intermediary to \nsubmit a VAT return for the purposes of the Import Scheme by the end \nof the month following a taxable period, and to remit the VAT due on \nsupplies made under the Import Scheme. Paragraph (b) provides that a \nVAT return must be made even if no supplies have been made for that \nmonth. \n\nSubsection (12) provides that the VAT return made under subsection (11) \nmust be made in euro and sets out the details of what is to be included in \nthe VAT return. \n\nSubsection (13) describes the exchange rate to be used where supplies \nmade under the Import Scheme are not made in the euro. \n\nSubsection (14) provides that a correction may be made to a previously \nsubmitted VAT return in a subsequent return within 3 years of the \noriginal return being submitted. Paragraph (b) details the information to \nbe provided where such a correction is being made. \n\nSubsection (15) holds that a taxable person may not make a deduction in \nthe VAT return to be submitted for the purposes of the Import Scheme. \n\nSubsections (16) and (17) provide that the Revenue Commissioners will \nissue an electronic reminder in relation to an outstanding VAT return or \npayment to a taxable person or an intermediary on the 10th day after: \n\n• \n\nthe date on which a VAT return was to be submitted, or \n\n• a VAT return is received but partial or no payment has been \n\nmade. \n\nSubsection (18) contains the record keeping obligations which taxable \npersons and intermediaries must adhere to under the Import Scheme. The \nrecords must be sufficiently detailed to enable the Member State of \nconsumption to verify that the VAT return is correct, must be made \navailable to the Revenue Commissioners and Member States in which \nthe transactions are taxable on request, and must be retained for a period \nof 10 years from 31 December of the year in which the transaction was \ncarried out. \n\nSection 91K sets out the manner in which the Import Scheme operates where the \nState is the Member State of consumption to which goods are supplied. \n\nSubsection (1) provides that a person who is registered for the Import \nScheme in the State or in another Member State, is an accountable person \nin relation to goods supplied in the State under the Import Scheme. \n\nSubsections (2), (3) and (4) provide that a person who is registered for \nthe Import Scheme in another Member State and who, in accordance with \nthe provisions of the scheme in that other Member State, files a return \nand pays the tax due in the State, will be regarded as having fulfilled his \n\n \n\f42 [327] \n\nor her obligations in relation to registration, returns and payments under \nthe VAT Consolidation Act 2010. The returns and payments made under \nthe provisions of the Import Scheme will be regarded as if they were \nreturns and payments which were required to be made under the normal \nreturn and payments provisions of the Act. \n\nSubsection (5) deals with the exchange rate to be applied where supplies \nare not made in the euro in the Import Scheme. \n\nSubsection (6) deals with the entitlement to deduct VAT for taxable \npersons registered for the Import Scheme. \n\nSubsection (7) deals with record keeping requirements. \n\nRegulation 23 contains a consequential amendment to section 101(14)(a). This \namendment inserts a reference to goods supplied under the Import Scheme which \nare taxable in the State. \n\nRegulation 24 contains a consequential amendment to section 102(3)(b). This \namendment inserts a reference to goods supplied under the Import Scheme which \nare taxable in the State. \n\nRegulation 25 amends section 111(1) to insert references to section 91J(10) \nthroughout that section. \n\nRegulation 26 amends section 115(1) to provide that paragraph (a) of that \nsection will not apply to an intermediary where that intermediary is jointly and \nseverally liable under section 91J(10). \n\nRegulation 27 amends section 116 to provide that the section will not apply to \nan intermediary where that intermediary is jointly and severally liable under \nsection 91J(10). \n\nRegulation 28 amends section 120 of the Act.

This new \nsubparagraph provides that the supply of goods to a taxable person who \nis subsequently the deemed supplier of those goods is zero-rated. \n\nParagraph (b) inserts a new subparagraph (3) into paragraph 2. This new \nsubparagraph provides that the importation of goods into the State is \nzero-rated where the Import Scheme is used to declare and pay the VAT \ndue on the importation of the goods. \n\nRegulation 30 amends Part 1 and Part 2 of Schedule 9 of the Act to reflect the \nchange to the scope of the Union and non-Union schemes.
