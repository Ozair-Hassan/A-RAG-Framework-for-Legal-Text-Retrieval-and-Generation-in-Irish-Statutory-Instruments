The updated list of published conservation objectives referred \nto in Regulation 3 is available on www.npws.ie. Public authorities should have \nregard to these objectives when undertaking a screening or appropriate \nassessment of plans or projects in accordance with the EU Habitats Directive. \n\nThose activities that require consent of the Minister or in some circumstances \nanother public authority listed at Schedule 4 to these Regulations are cited for \ntheir potential to cause disturbance or damage to the natural habitat types and \nanimal and plant species specified in Schedule 3 of these Regulations. \nLandowners or occupiers should contact the local National Parks and Wildlife \nService office of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage \nbefore undertaking any of the works listed at Schedule 4.
