In AAS Base Stations the antenna \nsystem is integrated as part of the Base Station system or product; \n\n“Non-Active Antenna Systems” or “non-AAS” means a Base Station and an \nantenna system that provides one or more antenna connectors, which are \nconnected to one or more separately designed passive antenna elements to \nradiate radio waves.
