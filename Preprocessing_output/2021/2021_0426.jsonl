The hyperlink: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/habitatsdirective/index_en.htm \nwhich connects to the European Commission Environment (Nature and Biodiversity) \nwebsite also contains a further link to the text of the Habitats Directive. \n\nThe effect of these Regulations is to complete the formal designation of the site as a \nSpecial Area of Conservation in accordance with Article 4 of the Directive. The \ngeographical area of the Special Area of Conservation designated by these \nRegulations is defined in Schedule 1 (a map of the area) and Schedule 2 (a list of the \ntownlands in question or a description of the area). For more detailed maps than those \ncontained in Schedule 1, or for greater detail on boundary delineation, contact should \nbe made with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Housing, \nLocal Government and Heritage or by viewing the relevant text or map details on \nwww.npws.ie. \n\nThe natural habitat types and animal and plant species lists cited in Schedule 3 of \nthese Regulations are specified, in accordance with the Directive, in order to ensure \ntheir conservation (i.e. the measures required to maintain or restore the natural habitats \nand the populations of species of wild fauna and flora at a favourable status). The \nupdated list of published conservation objectives referred to in Regulation 3 is \navailable on www.npws.ie. Public authorities should have regard to these objectives \nwhen undertaking a screening or appropriate assessment of plans or projects in \naccordance with the EU Habitats Directive. \n\nThose activities that require consent of the Minister or in some circumstances another \npublic authority listed at Schedule 4 to these Regulations are cited for their potential to \ncause disturbance or damage to the natural habitat types and animal and plant species \nspecified in Schedule 3 of these Regulations. Landowners or occupiers should contact \nthe local National Parks and Wildlife Service office of the Department of Housing, \nLocal Government and Heritage before undertaking any of the works listed at \nSchedule 4. (See www.npws.ie for contact details). Please note that activities other \nthan those listed at Schedule 4 to these Regulations, such as effluent discharge, \nconstruction work, aquaculture, fishing or forestry require a licence or permission \nfrom the appropriate consent authority. \n\nThese Regulations provide (Regulations 6 and 7) that contravention of the provisions \nof these Regulations shall constitute an offence. Regulation 6 also provides for \npenalties. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[ ] 11 \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \n52 FAICHE STIABHNA, BAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 2, \nD02 DR67. \n\nTeil: 076 110 6834 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \n52 ST.
