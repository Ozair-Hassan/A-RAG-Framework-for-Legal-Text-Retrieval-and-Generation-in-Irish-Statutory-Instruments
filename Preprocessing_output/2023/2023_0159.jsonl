A provoked epileptic seizure is defined as a \nseizure which has a recognisable causative factor that is avoidable. \n\nA person who has an initial or isolated seizure or loss of consciousness \nshould be advised not to drive. A specialist report is required, stating \nthe period of driving prohibition and the requested follow-up. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f20 [159] \n\nIt is extremely important that the person’s specific epilepsy syndrome \nand seizure type are identified so that a proper evaluation of the \nperson’s driving safety can be undertaken (including the risk of further \nseizures) and the appropriate therapy instituted. This should be done by \na neurologist. \n\n(b) In the case of an applicant for a licence or permit, or renewal of a \nlicence or permit, to drive a vehicle of any category A, A1, A2, AM, B, \nBE or W — \n\n (i) drivers assessed with epilepsy should be under licence review \nuntil they have been seizure-free for at least five years; \n\n(ii) if the person has epilepsy, the criteria for an unconditional \nlicence are not met. Notification should be given to the licensing \nauthority; \n\n(iii) provoked epileptic seizure: the applicant who has had a \nprovoked epileptic seizure because of a recognisable provoking \nfactor that is unlikely to recur at the wheel can be declared able to \ndrive on an individual basis, subject to neurological opinion the \nassessment should be, if appropriate, in accordance with other \nrelevant sections of this Schedule (e.g. in the case of alcohol or \nother co-morbidity); \n\n(iv) First or single unprovoked seizure: the applicant who has had a \nfirst unprovoked epileptic seizure can be declared able to drive \nafter a period of six months without seizures if there has been an \nappropriate medical assessment. Drivers with recognised good \nprognostic indicators may drive sooner; \n\n(v) Other loss of consciousness: the loss of consciousness should be \nassessed according to the risk of recurrence while driving; \n\n(vi) Epilepsy: persons can be declared fit to drive after a one-year \nperiod free of further seizures; \n\n(vii) Seizures exclusively in sleep: the applicant or driver who has \nnever had any seizures other than seizures during sleep can be \ndeclared fit to drive so long as this pattern has been established for \na period which must not be less than the seizure-free period \nrequired for epilepsy. If there is an occurrence of attacks/seizure \narising while awake, a one-year period free of further event before \nlicensing is required; \n\n(viii) Seizures without influence on consciousness or the ability to \nact: the applicant or driver who has never had any seizures other \nthan seizures which have been demonstrated exclusively to affect \nneither consciousness nor cause any functional impairment can be \ndeclared fit to drive so long as this pattern has been established for \na period which must not be less than the seizure-free period \nrequired for epilepsy.

Seizures \noccurring during physician-advised change or withdrawal of \nmedication require three months off driving if the previously \neffective treatment is reinstated; \n\n(x) Subsequent to curative epilepsy surgery: see paragraph (2)(a) \nabove. \n\n(c) In the case of an applicant for a licence or permit, or renewal of a \nlicence or permit, to drive a vehicle of any category C, CE, C1, C1E, D, \nDE, D1 or D1E— \n\n (i) drivers assessed with epilepsy should be under licence review \nuntil they have been seizure-free for at least five years; \n\n (ii) the applicant should be without anti-epileptic medication for the \nrequired period of seizure freedom and an appropriate medical \nfollow-up has been done. On extensive neurological investigation, \nno relevant cerebral pathology was established and there is no \nepileptiform activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG). An EEG \nand an appropriate neurological assessment should be performed \nafter the acute episode; \n\n (iii) provoked epileptic seizure: the applicant who has had a \nprovoked epileptic seizure because of a recognisable provoking \nfactor that is unlikely to recur at the wheel can be declared able to \ndrive on an individual basis, subject to neurological opinion. An \nEEG and an appropriate neurological assessment should be \nperformed after the acute episode. A person with a structural intracerebral lesion who has increased risk of seizures should not be \nable to drive vehicles of these categories until the epilepsy risk has \nfallen to at least 2% per annum. The assessment should be, if \nappropriate, in accordance with other relevant sections of this \nSchedule (e.g. in the case of alcohol); \n\n (iv) First or single unprovoked seizure: the applicant who has had a \nfirst unprovoked epileptic seizure can be declared able to drive \nonce five years’ freedom from further seizures has been achieved \nwithout the aid of anti-epileptic drugs if there has been an \nappropriate neurological assessment. Drivers with recognised good \nprognostic indicators may drive sooner; \n\n (v) Other loss of consciousness: the loss of consciousness should be \nassessed according to the risk of recurrence while driving. The risk \nof recurrence should be 2% per annum or less; \n\n (vi)10 years freedom from further seizures shall have been \nachieved without the aid of anti-epileptic drugs. A licence or permit \nmay be granted sooner than ten years to applicants with recognised \ngood prognostic indicators. This also applies in case of “juvenile \nepilepsy”. \n\n \n\f22 [159] \n\nCertain disorders (e.g. arterio-venous malformation or intra-cerebral \nhaemorrhage) entail an increased risk of seizures, even if seizures have \nnot yet occurred. In such a situation an assessment should be carried out \nby a competent medical authority; the risk of having a seizure should be \n2% per annum or less to allow licensing. \n\n(3) In the case of an applicant for a licence or permit, or renewal of a licence or \npermit, to drive vehicles of category A, A1, A2, AM, B, BE or W who suffers \nfrom a cerebrovascular disease, fitness to drive may be certified— \n\n(a) provided that, where necessary, the controls of the vehicle to be \ndriven are suitably rearranged or modified or a suitable special type of \nvehicle is used, and \n\n(b) for a limited period only to ensure that the applicant remains under \nmedical supervision. \n\nIn the case of an applicant for a licence or permit, or renewal of a licence or \npermit, to drive vehicles of category A, A1, A2, AM, B, BE or W who has \nsuffered a lesion with damage to the spinal cord and resultant paraplegia, \nfitness to drive may be certified subject to the vehicle to be driven being fitted \nwith special controls. \n\nIn the case of an applicant for a licence to drive vehicles of category C, CE, \nC1, C1E, D, DE, D1 or D1E, fitness to drive shall not be certified where the
