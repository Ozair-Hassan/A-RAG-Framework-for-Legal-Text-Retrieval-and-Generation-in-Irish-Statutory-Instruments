For new claims made in 2023, the GCY is 2021. Similar arrangements \napply to Illness Benefit (IB). \n\nAs respects the contribution condition, the Social Welfare (Covid-19) \n(Amendment) Act 2020 provided that a person entitled to and in receipt of \nPandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) or Jobseeker’s payment who had an \nunderlying entitlement to PUP would be deemed to have made an employment \ncontribution for each entitlement period the customer was in receipt of these \npayments. \n\nThe rate of payment of JB, JBSE and IB is determined by the person's average \nreckonable weekly earnings or income in the GCY. For the full rate to be paid, \nthe earnings in the GCY divided by the number of qualifying contributions in \nthat year must be above the statutory amount of €300. \n\nAs respects earnings, those in receipt of PUP in 2021 (GCY for 2023 claims), \nand who do not have any actual earnings and related paid contributions in \n2021, will not have the required €300 average earnings. These Regulations \nprovide that a recipient in this position will be considered to have satisfied the \ncondition to have the required €300 average earnings, and will be entitled to \npayment at the maximum rate. However, in cases where there are actual \nearnings and related paid contributions in the GCY, the standard calculation of \nearnings divided by paid contributions will apply. \n\nThese Regulations apply to the exceptional circumstances which applied in \n2020 and 2021 to provide that a person who was in receipt of PUP during the \ngoverning contribution years of 2020 or 2021 is regarded as satisfying the \nGCY earnings requirement for those years. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[234] 5 \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€ 3.00 \n\n(DEASP-158) 75. 5/23.
