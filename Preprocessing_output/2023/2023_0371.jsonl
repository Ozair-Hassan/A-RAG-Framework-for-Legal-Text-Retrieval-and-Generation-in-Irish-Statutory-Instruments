No. 371 of 2023", "title": "conferred on me by section 10(1) of the Civil Defence Act 2023 (No. 17 of 2023)", "year": 2023, "heading": "3. Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Harassment & Bullying", "text_raw": "3. Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Harassment & Bullying \n\nUnacceptable forms of behaviour such as discrimination, harassment, sexual \nharassment and bullying will not be tolerated. Such behaviour contravenes the \nvoluntary ethos and professionalism of the organisation. \n\nMaintaining a positive environment not only places an obligation on the \ncommand structure of the organisation, but is also the responsibility of all \nvolunteers. Volunteers must always treat their fellow volunteers with respect and \nensure that their own actions and behaviour do not cause offence to others or \ncontribute in any way to a discriminatory environment. \n\nVolunteers are expected to support this code on discrimination, sexual \nharassment, harassment or bullying by bringing any instances where such \nbehaviour has occurred to the attention of their unit Officer, Commander, \nAssistant Civil Defence Officer (ACDO) or Civil Defence Officer (CDO) at an \nearly stage and by co-operating with any ensuing investigation whether as a \ncomplainant, the person complained of or as a witness. \n\nIt is important to make every effort to ensure that volunteers involved in an \ninvestigation into discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment or bullying \nobserve confidentiality and that witnesses to an investigation respect the privacy \nof the parties involved and refrain from discussing any matters pertaining to the \ninvestigations. \n\nThis Code governs practice and disciplinary procedures within the Civil Defence \norganisation only. It does not have any bearing on a volunteer’s legal or statutory \nrights and obligations. \n\nFor the purposes of this code, the definitions of discrimination, harassment and \nsexual harassment have been taken from the Equal Status Acts 2000-2018 and \nthe Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015. The definition of bullying is taken \nfrom the 2021 Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention \nand Resolution of Bullying at Work by the Health & Safety Authority and the \nWorkplace Relations Commission. As it represents current best practice, it is the \nintention of the Civil Defence to apply these definitions notwithstanding the fact \nthat volunteers are not deemed to be employees of the local authority. \n\n \n \n \n \n\f[371] 9 \n\nDiscrimination \n\nDiscrimination is defined as the treatment of a person in a less favourable way \nthan another person is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation \non any of the nine grounds which exists, existed, may exist in the future or is \nimputed to the person concerned. The nine grounds are gender, civil status, \nfamily status, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, religion, and membership \nof the Traveller community. There are different types of discrimination covered \nincluding indirect discrimination, discrimination by imputation and by \nassociation. \n\nHarassment \n\nHarassment takes place where an individual subjects another individual to any \nunwelcome act, request or Practice including spoken words, gestures, or the \nproduction, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material \nthat could reasonably be regarded as offensive, humiliating or intimidating. The \nharassment must be based on one or more of the eight non-gender discriminatory \ngrounds outlined above. Harassment extends to situations where the person does \nnot have the relevant characteristic but the harasser believes that he/she has that \ncharacteristic. \n\nThe list is not exhaustive but some examples of harassment are: \n\n• Verbal harassment including jokes, comments, ridicule or songs; \n\n• Written harassment including graffiti, emails, texts, social media or \ninternet posts; \n\n• Physical harassment – jostling, shoving or any form of assault; \n\n• Intimidatory harassment – gestures, posturing or threatening poses; \n\n• Visual displays - posters, emblems or badges; and \n\n• Isolation or exclusion from social activities. \n\nSexual Harassment \n\nSexual Harassment is defined under the Employment Equality Acts as any form \nof unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which has \nthe purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity and creating an intimidating, \ndegrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the person. \n\nSuch unwanted conduct may consist of acts, requests, spoken words, gestures or \nthe production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material. \n\nThe list is not exhaustive but some examples of sexual harassment are as follows: \n\n• Physical conduct of a sexual nature - this may include unwanted physical \ncontact such as unnecessary touching, patting or pinching or brushing \nagainst another employee’s body, assault and coercive sexual intercourse; \n\n• Verbal conduct of a sexual nature - this includes unwelcome sexual \nadvances, propositions or pressure for sexual contact, continued suggestions \n\n \n \n \n \n\f10 [371] \n\nfor social contact outside the work place after it has been made clear that \nsuch suggestions are unwelcome, unwanted or offensive, suggestive \nremarks, innuendo or lewd comments, graffiti, written materials, emails, \ntext messages or social media posts; \n\n• Non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature - this may include the display of \npornographic or sexually suggestive pictures or objects. It may also include \nstalking, indecent exposure, leering, whistling or making sexually \nsuggestive gestures; and \n\n• Gender-based conduct - this includes conduct that denigrates or is \nabusive of an employee for reasons related to his or her sex such as \nderogatory or degrading abuse or insults which are gender-based. This \nmight include conduct that insults or degrades an employee because she is \npregnant or because s/he is transgender \n\nBullying \n\nBullying can be defined as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, \nwhether verbal, physical or otherwise practiced by one or more persons against \nanother or others in the course of their Civil Defence duties which could \nreasonably be regarded as undermining the individual's right to dignity. An \nisolated incident of the behaviour described in this definition is undesirable but \nas a once-off incident is not considered to be bullying. \n\nOn occasion you may receive feedback regarding your performance. Bullying \ndoes not arise where negative feedback is given constructively and honestly and \nrelates to issues relevant to your official duties within the organisation. \n\nThe list is not exhaustive but some examples of bullying are: \n\n• Exclusion with negative consequences \n\n• Verbal abuse/insults \n\n• Belittling a person’s opinion \n\n• Disseminating malicious rumours, gossip or innuendo \n\n• Socially excluding or isolating a person within the Civil Defence sphere \n\n• Intrusion – pestering, spying or stalking \n\n• Intimidation/aggressive interactions \n\n• Withholding information necessary for proper performance of a person’s \nrole \n\n• Blaming a person for things beyond their control \n\n• Use of aggressive and obscene language \n\n• Other menacing behaviour \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[371] 11", "text_norm": "3 discrimination harassment sexual harassment bullying unacceptable form behaviour discrimination harassment sexual harassment bullying tolerated behaviour contravenes voluntary ethos professionalism organisation maintaining positive environment place obligation command structure organisation also responsibility volunteer volunteer must always treat fellow volunteer respect ensure action behaviour cause offence others contribute way discriminatory environment volunteer expected support code discrimination sexual harassment harassment bullying bringing instance behaviour occurred attention unit officer commander assistant civil defence officer (acdo) civil defence officer (cdo) early stage co-operating ensuing investigation whether complainant person complained witness important make every effort ensure volunteer involved investigation discrimination harassment sexual harassment bullying observe confidentiality witness investigation respect privacy party involved refrain discussing matter pertaining investigation code governs practice disciplinary procedure within civil defence organisation only bearing volunteer legal statutory right obligation purpose code definition discrimination harassment sexual harassment taken equal status act 2000-2018 employment equality act 1998-2015 definition bullying taken 2021 code practice employer employee prevention resolution bullying work health safety authority workplace relation commission represents current best practice intention civil defence apply definition notwithstanding fact volunteer deemed employee local authority 371 9 discrimination discrimination defined treatment person le favourable way another person would treated comparable situation nine ground exists existed may exist future imputed person concerned nine ground gender civil status family status age disability sexual orientation race religion membership traveller community different type discrimination covered including indirect discrimination discrimination imputation association harassment harassment take place individual subject another individual unwelcome act request practice including spoken word gesture production display circulation written word picture material could reasonably regarded offensive humiliating intimidating harassment must based one eight non-gender discriminatory ground outlined above harassment extends situation person relevant characteristic harasser belief characteristic list exhaustive example harassment verbal harassment including joke comment ridicule song written harassment including graffiti email text social medium internet post physical harassment -

Other matters \n\nEqual Status Act \n\nCivil Defence acknowledges and respects the cultural and religious diversity that \nexists within Ireland and seeks to ensure that its volunteer base reflects the \ndiversity of the local communities in which it operates. Any person over the age \nof 18 and resident in Ireland may apply to join the organisation regardless of age, \ngender, sexual orientation, race, marital status, disability, membership of the \ntraveller community, family status, religion, colour, nationality, ethnic or \nnational origin, gender non-conformity, political opinion, residence status or \nsocial origin. \n\nInsurance \n\nThe Department of Defence has a Public Liability policy in place that protects \nCivil Defence in respect of claims being made against Civil Defence volunteers \nwhilst participating in Civil Defence activities, subject to the terms conditions \nand exclusions of that policy. The Department also has insurance policies in \nplace to compensate volunteers who suffer injury during the course of their Civil \nDefence activities. \n\nExpenses \n\nCivil Defence recognises that some financial expense may be incurred during \nthe course of volunteering. Reasonable out of pocket expenses may be \nreimbursed in accordance with approved rates and with the prior approval of the \nCDO or ACDO. \n\nAcceptance of Gifts, Rewards, Hospitality and Fund Raising \n\nAlthough outside organisations may regard offers of hospitality as normal \nbusiness practice, Civil Defence volunteers must exercise the utmost discretion \nin deciding whether or not to accept such offers. \n\nGifts, Rewards, Hospitality \n\nIn line with this code, a volunteer is prohibited from seeking, exacting or \naccepting any remuneration, fee, reward or other favour for any act done or \nnot done by virtue of his or her Civil Defence activities. The overriding \nconcern in all cases is that the actions of volunteer should be above suspicion \nand not give rise to any conflict of interest and that their dealings with the \npublic should bear the closest possible scrutiny and avoid any risk of damage \nto public confidence in Civil Defence. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f16 [371] \n\nThe following practice must be followed in relation to gifts: - \n\n• a volunteer should not solicit gifts directly or indirectly; \n\n• any gift other than a modest token should be courteously but firmly \ndeclined; \n\n• \nin all cases the offer or receipt of any gift (other than what is clearly a \nmodest token) should be reported to the volunteer’s CDA or ACDO \nsupervisor \n\nHowever, the normal presentation of modest gifts or tokens exchanged or given \nwould not be precluded. A volunteer approached with an offer or an award or \nprize by an outside organisation which is in any way connected with your official \nduty must consult their CDO or ACDO. \n\nFund Raising \n\nCivil Defence is funded by the Department of Defence and the local authority. \nIt is not a charitable organization. Fund raising for Civil Defence is not \nacceptable. Small fund raising activities for recognised charitable purposes are \nacceptable. If the CDO or ACDO is in any doubt regarding these activities they \nshould contact their Director of Services, or equivalent. \n\nPolitical Activities \n\nCivil Defence is a State organisation. It is important that personal views are not \nreflected in the discharge of your Civil Defence activities. All volunteers are \nbarred from any form of political activity whilst in uniform or engaged in any \nCivil Defence activities. \n\nIf you wish to take part in an outside activity, which involves the disclosure of \nofficial information, or use of official experience, you must obtain prior authority \nfrom your CDO or ACDO. The request must be made in sufficient time to allow \nproper consideration. The following principles cover all activities in which \nofficial information or experience is used. This includes the publication of books \nor articles, contacts with the press, broadcasts, speeches or lectures, and \nparticipation in outside conferences. \n\nThey are that you must not: \n\n• Discuss matters of current or potential political controversy in respect of \nCivil Defence Code; \n\n• Comment on individuals or organisations in terms that Civil Defence \nwould find objectionable; and \n\n• Take part in activities, which conflict with the interests of Civil Defence \nor bring the good name of the organisation into disrepute. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fQueries relating to any element of this Code should be discussed with the CDO \nor ACDO in the first instance. \n\n[371] 17 \n\nGIVEN under my Official Seal, \n\n12 July, 2023. \n\nMICHEÁL MARTIN, \nMinister for Defence. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f18 [371]", "text_norm": "9 matter equal status act civil defence acknowledges respect cultural religious diversity exists within ireland seek ensure volunteer base reflects diversity local community operates person age 18 resident ireland may apply join organisation regardless age gender sexual orientation race marital status disability membership traveller community family status religion colour nationality ethnic national origin gender non-conformity political opinion residence status social origin insurance department defence public liability policy place protects civil defence respect claim made civil defence volunteer whilst participating civil defence activity subject term condition exclusion policy department also insurance policy place compensate volunteer suffer injury course civil defence activity expense civil defence recognises financial expense may incurred course volunteering reasonable pocket expense may reimbursed accordance approved rate prior approval cdo acdo acceptance gift reward hospitality fund raising although outside organisation may regard offer hospitality normal business practice civil defence volunteer must exercise utmost discretion deciding whether accept offer gift reward hospitality line code volunteer prohibited seeking exacting accepting remuneration fee reward favour act done done virtue civil defence activity overriding concern case action volunteer suspicion give rise conflict interest dealing public bear closest possible scrutiny avoid risk damage public confidence civil defence 16 371 following practice must followed relation gift - volunteer solicit gift directly indirectly gift modest token courteously firmly declined case offer receipt gift (other clearly modest token) reported volunteer cda acdo supervisor however normal presentation modest gift token exchanged given would precluded volunteer approached offer award prize outside organisation way connected official duty must consult cdo acdo fund raising civil defence funded department defence local authority charitable organization fund raising civil defence acceptable small fund raising activity recognised charitable purpose acceptable cdo acdo doubt regarding activity contact director service equivalent political activity civil defence state organisation important personal view reflected discharge civil defence activity volunteer barred form political activity whilst uniform engaged civil defence activity wish take part outside activity involves disclosure official information use official experience must obtain prior authority cdo acdo request must made sufficient time allow proper consideration following principle cover activity official information experience used includes publication book article contact press broadcast speech lecture participation outside conference must discus matter current potential political controversy respect civil defence code comment individual organisation term civil defence would find objectionable take part activity conflict interest civil defence bring good name organisation disrepute query relating element code discussed cdo acdo first instance 371 17 given official seal 12 july 2023 micheal martin minister defence 18 371", "start_char": 30676, "end_char": 35324, "source_path": "downloads\\2023\\2023_0371.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "checksum": "sha256:73cd6288536b684d6be9ecec84a860a48ee91433e2aec8640b48a4deaaf6db4c", "cross_refs": []}
