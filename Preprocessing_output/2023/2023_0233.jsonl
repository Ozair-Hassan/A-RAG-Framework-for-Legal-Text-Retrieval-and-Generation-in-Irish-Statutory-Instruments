The \nRegulations aim to reduce the administrative cost for companies, whilst \nsafeguarding other legitimate public interests such as the protection of \nemployees, creditors, and minority shareholders along with the introduction of \nan anti-abuse provision. \n\nThe anti-abuse provision provides that the Court must scrutinise the legality of \nthe cross-border operation within three months of receiving an application. \nWhere the Court has serious doubts about whether the operation is for abusive \nor fraudulent purposes, an assessment must be conducted on a case-by-case \nbasis. In such a scenario, the scrutiny period may be extended by the Court for \nanother three months. The Court may, as part of its examination, consult an \nindependent expert and/or other relevant authorities within and outside its \njurisdiction if necessary. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f96 [233] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€ 25.00 \n\n(CLU-24) 85. 5/23.
