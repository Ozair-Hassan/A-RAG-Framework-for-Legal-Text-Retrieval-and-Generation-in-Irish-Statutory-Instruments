It is defined by taking the fixed \nnumerical value of the caesium frequency Δν Cs, the unperturbed ground-state \nhyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 \nwhen expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s– 1. \n\n Unit of length \n\nThe metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed \nnumerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299 792 458 when \nexpressed in the unit m/s, where the second is defined in terms of Δν Cs. \n\n Unit of mass \n\nThe kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the \nfixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6,626 070 15 × 10– 34 \nwhen expressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m2 s– 1, where the metre \nand the second are defined in terms of c and Δν Cs. \n\n Unit of electric current \n\nThe ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by taking \nthe fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be 1,602 176 634 × \n10– 19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s, where the second is \ndefined in terms of Δν Cs. \n\n Unit of thermodynamic temperature \n\nThe kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. It is \ndefined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to be \n1,380 649 × 10– 23 when expressed in the unit J K– 1, which is equal to kg m2 s– \n2 K– 1, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and \nΔν Cs. \n\n Unit of amount of substance \n\nThe mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole \ncontains exactly 6,022 140 76 × 1023 elementary entities. This number is the \nfixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, N A, when expressed in the \nunit mol– 1 and is called the Avogadro number. \n\nThe amount of substance, symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of \nspecified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a \n\n \n \n\f4 [154] \n\nmolecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles. \n\n Unit of luminous intensity \n\nThe candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in a given \ndirection. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous \nefficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 × 1012 Hz, K cd, to be \n683 when expressed in the unit lm W– 1, which is equal to cd sr W– 1, or cd sr \nkg– 1 m– 2 s3, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c \nand Δν Cs.", "text_norm": "3 section 1.1 schedule 1 principal regulation replaced following-- 1.1 si base unit quantity time length mass electric current thermodynamic temperature unit name symbol second metre kilogram kg ampere kelvin k 1 council directive 80 181 eec 20 december 1979 approximation law member state relating unit measurement repeal directive 71 354 eec (oj l 39 15.2.1980 p 40) 2 oj l 196 24.7.2019 p 6-9 notice making statutory instrument published iris oifigiuil 5th may 2020 154 3 mole mol candela cd amount substance luminous intensity definition si base unit unit time second symbol si unit time defined taking fixed numerical value caesium frequency dn c unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency caesium 133 atom 9 192 631 770 expressed unit hz equal s- 1 unit length metre symbol si unit length defined taking fixed numerical value speed light vacuum c 299 792 458 expressed unit second defined term dn c unit mass kilogram symbol kg si unit mass defined taking fixed numerical value planck constant h 6 626 070 15 x 10- 34 expressed unit j equal kg m2 s- 1 metre second defined term c dn c unit electric current ampere symbol si unit electric current defined taking fixed numerical value elementary charge e 1 602 176 634 x 10- 19 expressed unit c equal second defined term dn c unit thermodynamic temperature kelvin symbol k si unit thermodynamic temperature defined taking fixed numerical value boltzmann constant k 1 380 649 x 10- 23 expressed unit j k- 1 equal kg m2 s- 2 k- 1 kilogram metre second defined term h c dn c unit amount substance mole symbol mol si unit amount substance one mole contains exactly 6 022 140 76 x 1023 elementary entity number fixed numerical value avogadro constant n expressed unit mol- 1 called avogadro number amount substance symbol n system measure number specified elementary entity elementary entity may atom 4 154 molecule ion electron particle specified group particle unit luminous intensity candela symbol cd si unit luminous intensity given direction defined taking fixed numerical value luminous efficacy monochromatic radiation frequency 540 x 1012 hz k cd 683 expressed unit lm w- 1 equal cd sr w- 1 cd sr kg- 1 m- 2 s3 kilogram metre second defined term h c dn c", "start_char": 1097, "end_char": 4354, "source_path": "downloads\\2020\\2020_0153.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "checksum": "sha256:8fbb093f474867920c29d8d55c26cb90c203a128f434ba1ec3a73e2fc43f24f1", "cross_refs": []}
