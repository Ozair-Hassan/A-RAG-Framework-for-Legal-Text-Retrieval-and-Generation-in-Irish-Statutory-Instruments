It is a recast of an earlier Directive (Directive 2005/32/EC) which \nestablished a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energyusing products and extends the scope of the application of that Directive to a \nwider variety of products which do not consume energy during use but have a \nsignificant contribution to make to energy saving. \n\nThese Regulations amend the EU (Ecodesign Requirements for Certain \nEnergy-related Products) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 454 of \n2013). The Schedule expands the list of products and introduces the associated \nEU measures and allows for their enforcement. It revokes a number of existing \nEU measures and amends others. The Regulations oblige manufacturers, their \nauthorised representatives or, in their absence, an importer of a product listed \nin the Schedule, not to place the said product on the market or put it into \nservice if it does not conform to the applicable EU measure. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[625] 9 \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \n52 FAICHE STIABHNA, BAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 2, \nD02 DR67. \n\nTeil: 076 110 6834 \nr-post: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \n52 ST.
