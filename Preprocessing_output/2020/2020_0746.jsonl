From the end of that 18-month period, interest may be \ncharged by Party A on outstanding claims, calculated on the basis of a \nrate to be agreed between the Parties. \n\nSECTION 2 \n\nOLD-AGE BENEFIT AND SURVIVOR'S BENEFIT \n\nARTICLE 25 \n\nGeneral provisions \n\n(1) Where a person has been subject to the legislation of both Parties, each \nParty shall determine whether that person satisfies the conditions for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[746] 27 \n\nentitlement to old-age benefit under its legislation when it receives the \nperson’s claim for such benefit, unless the person has expressly requested \ndeferment of the award of old-age benefit under the legislation of that \nParty (where deferment is allowed under such legislation). \n\n(2) Where the person satisfies the conditions for entitlement to old-age \nbenefit under the legislation of both Parties, each Party shall calculate the \nperson’s entitlement to such benefit in accordance with Article 26. \n\n(3) \n\n(a) Where the person satisfies the conditions for entitlement to an oldage benefit under the legislation of one Party (Party A) but does not \nsimultaneously satisfy or no longer satisfies such conditions under \nthe legislation of the other Party (Party B), or has expressly \nrequested deferment of award of such benefit (and the legislation of \nParty B provides for such deferment), Party A shall calculate their \nentitlement to the benefit in accordance with sub-paragraph (b) and \nArticle 26. \n\n(b) Where paragraph (a) applies, when performing the calculation in \nArticle 26, Party A shall not take into account insurance periods \ncompleted under the legislation of Party B where this gives rise to a \nlower amount of old-age benefit. \n\n(c) As and when the person satisfies the entitlement conditions for oldage benefit under the legislation of Party B, or makes a claim to \nParty B for such benefit following deferment of it in accordance \nwith paragraph (1), each Party shall calculate the person’s \nentitlement to such benefit under its legislation in accordance with \nArticle 26, but Party B shall not take into account insurance periods \ncompleted under the legislation of Party A which have already been \ntaken into account by virtue of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b). \n\nARTICLE 26 \n\nCalculation and award of old-age benefit \n\n(1) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5) and Articles 27 to 29, the relevant Party \nshall calculate the amount of old-age benefit that would be due to be paid \nto a person: \n\n(a) \n\nunder the legislation it applies, where the person has satisfied the \nconditions for entitlement to the old-age benefit exclusively on the \nbasis of all the relevant insurance periods completed under the \nlegislation of that Party (the “independent amount”); and \n\n(b) on a pro- rata basis, as follows (the “pro- rata amount”): \n\n(i) \n\nfirstly, calculating the amount of old-age benefit which \nwould be payable by that Party if all the relevant insurance \nperiods completed by the person under the legislation of \nboth Parties had been completed under the legislation which \nit applies on the date of award of the benefit (the “theoretical \namount”); \n\n \n \n \n\f28 [746] \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthen, expressing the relevant insurance periods completed by \nthe person under the legislation of that Party as a percentage \nof the sum of all relevant insurance periods completed by \nthat person under the legislation of both Parties; \n\nlastly, by multiplying \npercentage calculated under paragraph (ii) above. \n\ntheoretical amount by \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n(2) Where appropriate, the relevant Party shall apply, to the independent \namount or the pro rata amount, all the rules relating to reduction, \nsuspension or withdrawal under the legislation it applies, within the \nlimits provided for by Articles 31 to 33. \n\n(3) The person concerned shall be entitled to receive from the Party the \n\nhigher of the independent amount and the pro rata amount. \n\n(4) Where, in a Party, the independent amount is invariably equal to or \nhigher than the pro rata amount, that Party need not carry out the \ncalculation of the pro rata amount. \n\n(5) For the purpose of determining the rate of state pension under section 2 \nor 4 of the Pensions Act 2014, the United Kingdom shall calculate the \namount of such benefit based solely on the insurance periods completed \nor, in accordance with Article 15(6) treated as paid, under its legislation. \n\n(6) For the purpose of the calculation in paragraph (1), where all the \ninsurance periods completed by a person under the legislation of the \nUnited Kingdom amount to less than one qualifying year, or relate only \nto periods ending before 6 April 1975 and in aggregate amount to less \nthan 50 weeks, those periods shall be treated as if they had been \ncompleted under the legislation of Ireland. \n\n(7) Any increase of benefit payable under the legislation of the United \nKingdom because of deferred retirement shall be based on the pro- rata \namount calculated in accordance with paragraph (1)(b) above. \n\n(8) Where all the insurance periods completed by a person under the \nlegislation of Ireland amount to less than one year, those periods shall be \ntreated as if they had been completed under the legislation of the United \nKingdom. \n\n(9) Notwithstanding Article 64, any Party which establishes, while \ninvestigating a claim for old-age benefits, that the person is entitled to an \nindependent amount under its legislation in accordance with paragraph \n(1)(a) above, shall pay that amount without delay on a provisional basis. \n\nARTICLE 27 \n\nInsurance periods to be taken into account \n\nFor the purpose of applying Article 26, a Party shall take into account only \ninsurance periods (completed under the legislation of either Party) which \nwould be taken into account for the determination of benefits under its \nlegislation if they were completed under that legislation. \n\n \n \n \n\f[746] 29 \n\nARTICLE 28 \n\nOverlapping contribution periods \n\nFor the purpose of applying Article 26: \n\n(a) where a compulsory contribution period or credited period \ncompleted under the legislation of one Party (Party A) coincides \nwith a voluntary contribution period or continued optional \ncontribution period completed under the legislation of the other \nParty (Party B), only the compulsory contribution period or \ncredited period shall be taken into account; \n\n(b) where a compulsory contribution period completed under the \nlegislation of Party A coincides with a credited period completed \nunder the legislation of Party B, only the contribution period \ncompleted under the legislation of Party A shall be taken into \naccount; \n\n(c) where a credited period completed under the legislation of one \nParty coincides with a credited period completed under the \nlegislation of the other Party, account shall be taken only of the \ncredited period completed: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nunder the legislation under which the person was last \ncompulsorily insured before the day when the periods in \nquestion began; or \n\nif they were never compulsorily insured before that day, \nunder the legislation under which they first became \ncompulsorily insured after the day when the periods in \nquestion ended; \n\n(d) where it is not possible to determine accurately the period of time \nin which certain insurance periods were completed under the \nlegislation of one Party, such insurance periods shall be treated as if \nthey did not overlap with insurance periods completed under the \nlegislation of the other Party and shall be taken into account where \npossible and to the best advantage of the person concerned. \n\n(e) Subject to sub-paragraph (f), where periods of voluntary or optional \ncontinued insurance have not been taken into account under this \nArticle, the Party under whose legislation those periods were \ncompleted shall, where possible, calculate the amount of old-age \nbenefit to which the person concerned would be entitled, on the \nbasis of those periods under the legislation it applies. The pro- rata \namount of the benefit payable to the person, calculated in \naccordance with Article 26(1), shall be increased by the amount \ncorresponding to periods of voluntary or optional continued \ninsurance. \n\n(f) Each Party shall calculate, under the legislation it applies, the \namount of old-age benefit to which the person concerned is \n\n \n \n \n\f30 [746] \n\nentitled, on the basis of periods of voluntary or optional continued \ninsurance which, under the last sentence of Article 31(3), shall not \nbe subject to the other Party’s rules relating to withdrawal, \nreduction or suspension. \n\nARTICLE 29 \n\nBenefits to be excluded \n\n(1) For the purpose of applying Article 26 no account shall be taken of the \nfollowing benefits payable to the person concerned under the legislation \nof the United Kingdom: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nany additional pension;

\n\nany increase where the person has attained pensionable age and is \nliving alone; \n\nany increase where the person has attained the age of 80 years; or \n\nany increase for living on a specified island; \n\nbut such payments shall, where appropriate, be added to the amount of \nbenefit payable under that legislation in accordance with Article 26(3). \n\nARTICLE 30 \n\nSurvivor’s benefit \n\nArticles 25 to 29 shall apply in the same way, subject to any necessary \nmodifications, to survivor’s benefit. \n\nARTICLE 31 \n\nRules to prevent overlapping \n\n(1) Any overlapping entitlement to an old-age, invalidity or survivor’s \nbenefit under the legislation of both Parties and calculated or provided on \nthe basis of insurance periods completed by the same person shall be \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[746] 31 \n\nconsidered, for the purposes of this Article and Article 32, to be \noverlapping of benefits of the same kind. \n\n(2) Overlapping entitlement to benefits which cannot be considered to be of \nthe same kind within the meaning of paragraph (1) shall be considered to \nbe overlapping of benefits of a different kind. \n\n(3) For the purpose of any rules preventing overlapping under the legislation \nof a Party (Party A) in the case of overlapping of an old-age, invalidity or \nsurvivor’s benefit with a benefit of the same kind or a benefit of a \ndifferent kind, Party A shall take into account the amount of benefits to \nbe paid to the person by the other Party (Party B) before deduction of tax, \nsocial security contributions and other individual levies or deductions, \nwhere the legislation of Party A provides for benefits acquired abroad to \nbe taken into account and unless such legislation provides otherwise. \nParty A shall not take into account any amount of benefits acquired under \nthe legislation of Party B on the basis of voluntary insurance or continued \noptional insurance. \n\n(4) \n\nIf one Party applies rules to prevent overlapping because the person \nconcerned receives benefits of the same or of a different kind under the \nlegislation of the other Party, the benefit due may be reduced solely by \nthe amount of such benefits. \n\nARTICLE 32 \n\nOverlapping of benefits of the same kind \n\nWhere benefits of the same kind due under the legislation of both Parties \noverlap, the rules to prevent overlapping laid down by the legislation of a Party \nshall not be applicable to a pro-rata amount (calculated under Article 26(1)(b)). \n\nARTICLE 33 \n\nOverlapping of benefits of a different kind \n\n(1) \n\nIf the receipt of benefits of a different kind requires the application of the \nrules to prevent overlapping provided for by the legislation of the Parties \nregarding: \n\n(a) \n\ntwo independent amounts, the Parties shall divide the amounts of \nthe benefit or benefits, as they have been taken into account, by the \nnumber of benefits subject to the said rules;
