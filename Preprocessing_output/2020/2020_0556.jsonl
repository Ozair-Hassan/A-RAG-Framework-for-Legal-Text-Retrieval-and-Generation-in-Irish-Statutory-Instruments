Vehicles placed on the market are subject to \nthe Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003(S.I. No. \n5 of 2003) and must be constructed or adapted for left hand traffic. Essentially, \nno relevant vehicle under the scope of these Regulations may be sold, \nregistered or enter into service unless it is the subject of a certificate of \nconformity with a type-approval granted by the Approval Authority for the \nState (the National Standards Authority of Ireland) or by an approval authority \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[556] 333 \n\nof another Member State, or it is the subject of an individual vehicle approval \ngranted by such an authority. \n\nThese new Regulations provide for the establishment and appointment of an \nAutomotive Market Surveillance Authority for the State (the Road Safety \nAuthority) as required under Regulation (EU) 2018/858. Details of offences \nand penalties are provided, and the Regulations also permit the Automotive \nMarket Surveillance Authority to appoint authorised officers to carry out \ninvestigations under the Regulations. \n\nThese Regulations also create an internal review procedure regarding decisions \nof the Approval Authority or Automotive Market Surveillance Authority. \n\nThese Regulations include two Schedules relating to national type approvals: \n\n• Schedule 1 - describes the certain varieties of vehicle that are eligible \n\nfor national individual vehicle approval; and, \n\n• Schedule 2 - lays down the alternative technical requirements for \nnational small series type approval and national individual vehicle \napproval, including the technical requirements for vehicles included in \nSchedule 1. \n\nThese Regulations also revoke a number of statutory instruments in full or part \nof, that have until now, regulated some of the matters that these Regulations \naddress. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f334 [556] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \n52 FAICHE STIABHNA, BAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 2, \nD02 DR67. \n\nTeil: 076 110 6834 \nr-post: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \n52 ST.
