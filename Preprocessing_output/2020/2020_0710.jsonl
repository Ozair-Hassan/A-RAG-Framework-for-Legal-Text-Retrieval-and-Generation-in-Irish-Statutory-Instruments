a short period without incurring material losses \nunder normal market conditions, \n\nthe evaluation carried out in accordance with paragraphs (3) to \n(5) of Regulation 89 reveals that the

maintain an \nadequate level of additional own funds to cover the guidance \ncommunicated in accordance with Regulation 92B(4), or \n\n(f) \n\nthere are other institution-specific situations deemed by the \nBank to raise material supervisory concerns. \n\n(2) The Bank shall only impose the additional own funds requirement \nreferred to in Regulation 92(2)(a) to cover the risks incurred by individual \ninstitutions due to their activities, including those reflecting the impact of \ncertain economic and market developments on the risk profile of an individual \ninstitution. \n\n(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), risks or elements of risk shall only \nbe considered as not covered or not sufficiently covered by the own funds \nrequirements set out in Parts Three, Four and Seven

to be \nunderestimated despite compliance with the applicable requirements set out in \nParts Three, Four and Seven of the Capital Requirements Regulation and in \nChapter 2 of Regulation (EU)

in performing the review and evaluation, comes to the conclusion \nthat the institution’s management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading \nbook activities is adequate and that the institution is not excessively exposed to \ninterest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities. \n\n(8) Where additional own funds are required to address risks, other than the \nrisk of

quarters of the Tier 1 capital referred to in \nsubparagraph (a) shall be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital. \n\n(11) Subject to paragraph (12), an institution shall meet the additional own \nfunds requirement, imposed by the Bank under Regulation 92(2)(a) to address \nthe risk of excessive leverage, with Tier 1 capital. \n\n(12) The Bank may require an institution to meet its additional own funds \nrequirement with a higher portion of Tier 1 capital or Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital than that required under paragraph (10), where necessary, and having \nregard to the specific circumstances of the institution. \n\n(13) Own funds that are used to meet the additional own funds requirement \nreferred to in Regulation 92(2)(a) imposed by the Bank to address risks other \nthan the risk of excessive leverage shall not be used to meet any of the \nfollowing: \n\n(a) own funds requirements set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of \n\nArticle 92(1) of the Capital Requirements Regulation; \n\n(b) \n\nthe combined buffer requirement; \n\n(c) \n\nthe guidance on additional own funds referred to in Regulation \n92B(4) where that guidance addresses risks other than the risk of \nexcessive leverage. \n\n(14) Own funds that are used to meet the additional own funds requirement \nreferred to in Regulation 92(2)(a) imposed by the Bank to address the risk of \nexcessive leverage not sufficiently covered by point (d) of Article 92(1) of the \nCapital Requirements Regulation shall not be used to meet any of the \nfollowing: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nthe own funds requirement
