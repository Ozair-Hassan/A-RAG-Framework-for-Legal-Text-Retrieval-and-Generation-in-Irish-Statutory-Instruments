SMEs are \nexpected to be the main beneficiaries. In order to qualify for the Scheme, the \nborrower will have to declare an adverse impact of minimum 15% of actual or \nprojected turnover or profit due to the impact of COVID-19. \n\nThe current standard facility size for the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme \nwill be €10k to €1 million under the current Acts. \n\nThe qualifying enterprises will apply as normal to the finance providers for \nfinancial products, such as overdrafts or term loans. The finance providers will \napply their normal underwriting decision-making process to the applications \nfor financial products. \n\n \n \n \n \n\f[325] 15 \n\nThe qualifying enterprises will pay a premium to the State for the guarantee. \nThe State is required to charge this under the terms of the European \nCommission’s Temporary Framework for State aid measures and the 2012 Act. \n\nFinance providers are required to provide these financial products at reduced \ninterest rates to the qualifying enterprises, to take account of the reduced risk of \nthe finance providers in the case of any default arising. This will further \nsupport businesses to access essential liquidity as a result of the COVID-19 \ncrisis. \n\nThe Scheme has been designed to ensure it can be distributed and accessed as \nefficiently as possible. However, the European Commission State Aid \nTemporary Framework must be adhered to in order to take advantage of the \nderogations and increased State Aid limits within the Scheme. \n\nThe Scheme will be operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland \n(SBCI). The SBCI will also review prospective finance providers and make a \nrecommendation to the Minister regarding their participation in the Scheme. \n\nComponents of the S.I. \n\nThe S.I begins with the formal Citation for the Scheme and Interpretations and \nDefinitions applicable for the Scheme. \n\nIt then consists of two substantive parts; \n\nPart one sets out an overview of the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. This \nincludes: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe policy objectives of the Scheme to facilitate additional \nlending to businesses in response to the economic difficulties \ncaused by COVID-19. \n\nThe powers of minister to grant a guarantee subject to the \nconditions specified in section 4 and section 4A of the Credit \nGuarantee Act 2012 (as amended). \n\nthe facility and guarantee term applicable under the scheme. \n\nthe nominal values of financial products that are allowable under \nthe Scheme. \n\nThe nature of finance agreements that are considered as Eligible \nCredit under the Scheme. \n\nThe requirement to charge a premium as part of a credit \nagreement under the Scheme to a beneficiary availing of the \nScheme. \n\nThe application of a pricing discount, which participating finance \nproviders are required to include on credit agreements under the \nScheme in order to pass on the financial benefit of the State \nguarantee. \n\nSupport under this measure constitutes State aid within the \nmeaning of Article 107(1) TFEU. The Commission considers that \n\n \n \n\f16 [325] \n\nit is compatible pursuant to Article 107(3)(b) of the TFEU since it \nmeets all the relevant conditions of the Temporary Framework. \n\n \n\nConfirmation of compliance with Data Protection regulations. \n\nPart two describes the process of approval of finance providers to this Scheme \nand refers to the participating finance provider’s legal agreement. \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \n52 FAICHE STIABHNA, BAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 2, \nD02 DR67. \n\nTeil: 076 110 6834 \nr-post: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \n52 ST.
