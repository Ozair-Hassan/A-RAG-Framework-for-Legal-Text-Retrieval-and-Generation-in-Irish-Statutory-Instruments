These \nrestrictions apply only where necessary, and proportionate to the need, to \nsafeguard specified important objectives of general public interest pursued by \nthe Central Bank of Ireland (“relevant objectives”) set out in these Regulations. \n\nThese relevant objectives include, for example, regulating financial service \nproviders and markets, protecting the best interests of consumers of financial \nservices, supervising or enforcing compliance with financial services legislation, \ncarrying out monetary policy functions and contributing to the stability of the \nfinancial system. \n\nBy way of example, these restrictions could apply where the exercise of the right \nmay interfere with the prevention, detection or investigation of breaches of, or \nthe enforcement of compliance with, financial services legislation. The \nrestrictions could also apply where, for example, the exercise of the right would \ndisclose that the Central Bank of Ireland is carrying out certain tasks and such \ndisclosure may prejudice the achievement of a relevant objective. \n\nThe essence of the right to data protection of data subjects and the risks to the \nrights and freedoms of data subjects that may result from a restriction are matters \nthat are relevant in determining whether a restriction is necessary, and \nproportionate to the need, to safeguard a relevant objective. Furthermore, \nwhether a restriction will apply will be considered on a case-by-case basis \nfollowing an assessment of the relevant circumstances. Whether it is necessary \nand proportionate to restrict the right as a whole, or whether a partial restriction \nwould suffice to safeguard a relevant objective, will also be considered. \n\nWhere a right or obligation is restricted in accordance with these Regulations, \nthe Central Bank of Ireland is obliged to notify the data subject and provide the \nreasons for the restriction, unless to do so may prejudice the achievement of a \nrelevant objective. A notification must inform the data subject of the right or \nobligation affected by the restriction, whether the restriction applies in whole or \nin part, the data subject’s statutory right to lodge a complaint with the Data \nProtection Commission and that such right is without prejudice to other specific \nrights or remedies which the data subject may have in relation to the Central \nBank of Ireland. \n\nThese Regulations require the Central Bank of Ireland to have in place certain \npolicies and procedures relating to safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful \naccess or transfer and the storage periods and the applicable safeguards taking \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f8 [534] \n\ninto account the nature, scope and purposes of the processing or categories of \nprocessing. \n\nThese Regulations also require the Central Bank of Ireland to ensure that all \ninformation provided in relation to these Regulations is provided in a clear, \nconcise and accessible manner.
