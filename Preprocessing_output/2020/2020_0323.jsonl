(1) For the purpose of calculating whether the targets laid down in \npoints 2 (c), (d) and (e) of Regulation 31 have been attained: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nthe Agency shall calculate the weight of the municipal \nwaste generated and prepared for re-use or recycled in a \ngiven calendar year; \n\nthe weight of the municipal waste prepared for re-use shall \nbe calculated as the weight of products or components of \nproducts that have become municipal waste and have \nundergone all necessary checking, cleaning or repairing \noperations to enable re-use without further sorting or preprocessing; \n\nthe weight of the municipal waste recycled shall be \ncalculated as the weight of waste which, having undergone \nall necessary checking, sorting and other preliminary \noperations to remove waste materials that are not targeted \nby the subsequent reprocessing and to ensure high-quality \nrecycling, enters the recycling operation whereby waste \nmaterials are actually reprocessed into products, materials \nor substances. \n\n(2) For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 1, the weight of the \nmunicipal waste recycled shall be measured when the waste enters the \nrecycling operation. By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, \nthe weight of municipal waste recycled may be measured at the output \nof any sorting operation provided that: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nsuch output waste is subsequently recycled; \n\nthe weight of materials or substances that are removed by \nfurther operations preceding the recycling operation and \nare not subsequently recycled is not included in the weight \nof waste reported as recycled. \n\n(3) The Minister, the Agency and the local authorities, in carrying \nout their respective functions under the Act of 1996 shall establish an \neffective system of quality control and traceability of municipal waste \nto ensure that the conditions laid down in point (c) of paragraph 1 of \nthis Regulation and in paragraph 2 of this Regulation are met. To ensure \nthe reliability and accuracy of the data gathered on recycled waste, the \nsystem may consist of electronic registries set up pursuant to \nRegulation 45(4), technical specifications for the quality requirements \n\n \n \n\f[323] 25 \n\nof sorted waste, or average loss rates for sorted waste for various waste \ntypes and waste management practices respectively. Average loss rates \nshall only be used in cases where reliable data cannot be obtained \notherwise and shall be calculated on the basis of the calculation rules \nestablished in the delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 10 of \nArticle 11a of the Waste Directive. \n\n(4) For the purpose of calculating whether the targets laid down in \npoints 2 (c), (d) and (e) of Regulation 31 have been attained, the amount \nof municipal biodegradable waste that enters aerobic or anaerobic \ntreatment may be counted as recycled where that treatment generates \ncompost, digestate, or other output with a similar quantity of recycled \ncontent in relation to input, which is to be used as a recycled product, \nmaterial or substance. Where the output is used on land, this may be \ncounted as recycled only if this use results in benefits to agriculture or \necological improvement. As from 1 January 2027, municipal bio-waste \nentering aerobic or anaerobic treatment may be counted as recycled \nonly if, in accordance with Regulation 38, it has been separately \ncollected or separated at source. \n\n(5) For the purposes of calculating whether the targets laid down in \npoints 2 (c), (d) and (e) of Regulation 31 have been attained, the amount \nof waste materials that have ceased to be waste as a result of a \npreparatory operation before being reprocessed may be counted as \nrecycled provided that such materials are destined for subsequent \nreprocessing into products, materials or substances to be used for the \noriginal or other purposes. However, end-of-waste materials to be used \nas fuels or other means to generate energy, or to be incinerated, \nbackfilled or landfilled, shall not be counted towards the attainment of \nthe recycling targets. \n\n(6) For the purposes of calculating whether the targets laid down in \npoints 2 (c), (d) and (e) Regulation 31 have been attained, the Agency \nmay take into account the recycling of metals separated after \nincineration of municipal waste provided that the recycled metals meet \ncertain quality criteria laid down in the implementing act adopted \npursuant to paragraph 9 of Article 11a of the Waste Directive. \n\n(7) Waste collected in Ireland and exported to another Member \nState for the purposes of preparing for re-use, recycling or backfilling in \nthat other Member State may be counted towards the attainment of the \ntargets laid down in Regulation 31(2) in Ireland. \n\n(8) Waste collected in Ireland and exported from the Union for \npreparing for re-use or recycling shall count towards the attainment of \nthe targets laid down in Regulation 31(2) only if the requirements of \nparagraph 3 of this Regulation are met and if, in accordance with \nRegulation (EC) No 1013/2006, the exporter can prove that the \nshipment of waste complies with the requirements of that Regulation \nand that the treatment of waste outside the
