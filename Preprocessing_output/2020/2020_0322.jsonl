(S.I. No. 282 of 2014). Therefore, these Regulations \nprimarily consist of amendments to these two pieces of legislation. \n\nThe following table indicates how the Packaging Directive is transposed-and \nnotes where aspects which are the responsibility of the Commission are not \ntransposed. \n\nArticle \nDirective \nof \n2018/850/Amendments to Directive \n94/62/EC \n\nTransposed by Regulation No: \n\nArticle 1 - Purpose \n\n3 - Purpose of Regulations \n\nArticle 3 - Definitions \n\nArticle 4 – Prevention measures \n\nArticle 5 - Reuse \n\nArticle 6 – Recovery and recycling \n\n7 – Amending Regulation 4 \nRegulations of 2014. \n\nin \n\n10 – Insertion of new Regulation 38 \n(Prevention) into regulations of 2014 \n\n11 – Insertion of new Regulation 39 \n(Reuse) into regulations of 2014 \n\n8 – \ninsertion of Regulation 8A \n(Requirements on all producers to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[322] 17 \n\nrecover \nwaste) into the Regulations of 2014 \n\nrecycle packaging \n\nand \n\nArticle 6a – Rules on the calculation of \nthe attainment of the targets \n\nArticle 6b- Early warning report \n\nArticle 7 - Return, \nrecovery systems \n\ncollection \n\nand \n\nArticle 9 - Essential requirements \n\n12 – insertion of new regulation 40 \n(Rules on the calculation of the \nattainment of the targets) into the \nRegulations of 2014 \n\nCommission competence – not \ntransposed. \n\n13 – Insertion of Regulation 41 \n(Return, collection and \nrecovery \nsystems) into the Regulations of \n2014 \n\nCommission competence – not \ntransposed. \n\nArticle 11 - Concentration levels of \nheavy metals present in packaging \n\nCommission competence – not \ntransposed \n\nArticle 12 - Information systems and \nreporting \n\n14 – Insertion of Regulation 42 \n(Information systems and reporting) \ninto the Regulations of 2014 \n\nArticle 17 – Obligation \n(deletion) \n\nto report \n\nNo change required. \n\nArticle 19- Adaptation to scientific and \ntechnical progress \n\nCommission competence – not \ntransposed \n\nArticle 20 -Specific measures \n\nArticle 21- Committee procedure \n\nCommission competence – not \ntransposed \n\nCommission competence – not \ntransposed \n\nArticle 21a -Exercise of the delegation Commission competence – not \n\ntransposed \n\nAnnex II \n\nAnnex III \n\nAnnex IV \n\n16 - Amendment to Schedule 4 of \n2014 \n\n17 -Insertion of Schedule 5 into the \nRegulations of 2014 \n\n18 -Insertion of Schedule 6 into the \nRegulations of 2014 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f18 [322] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \n52 FAICHE STIABHNA, BAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 2, \nD02 DR67. \n\nTeil: 076 110 6834 \nr-post: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \n52 ST.
