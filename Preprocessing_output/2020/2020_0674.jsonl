It also applies to employees in relation \nto their duties under section 13 (1) (e) of the 2005 Act to ‘not engage in \nimproper conduct or behaviour that is likely to endanger his or her own \nsafety, health and welfare at work or that of any other person’. \n\nThis Code applies to all employments in Ireland irrespective of whether \nemployees work at a fixed location, at home or are mobile. \n\nExtracts from the 2005 Act which are relevant are set out in Appendix 2: \n\nFailure to follow this Code is not an offence in itself. However as regards the \nuse of Codes of Practice in criminal proceedings, section 61 of the 2005 Act \nprovides as follows- \n\n“61. (1) Where in proceedings for an offence under this Act relating to an alleged \ncontravention of any requirement or prohibition imposed by or under a relevant \nstatutory provision being a provision for which a Code of Practice had been \npublished or approved by the Authority under section 60 at the time of the \nalleged contravention, subsection (2) shall have effect with respect to that Code of \nPractice in relation to those proceedings. \n\n(2) \n\n(a) Where a Code of Practice referred to in subsection (1) appears to \nthe court to give practical guidance as to the observance of the \nrequirement or prohibition alleged to have been contravened, the \nCode of Practice shall be admissible in evidence. \n\n(b) Where it is proved that any act or omission of the defendant alleged \n\nto constitute the contravention: \n\nis a failure to observe a Code of Practice referred to in subsection \n(1), or \n\nis a compliance with that Code of Practice, \n\nthen such failure or compliance is admissible in evidence. \n\nA document bearing the seal of the Authority and purporting to be a Code of \nPractice or part of a code of practice published or approved of by the Authority \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f7 [674] \n\nunder this section shall be admissible as evidence in any proceedings under this \nAct.” \n\nStatus and Scope of the Code under Workplace Relations Legislation \n\nSection 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 provides for the preparation of \ndraft codes of practice by the Workplace Relations Commission for submission \nto the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Codes of Practice are \nwritten guidelines, agreed in a consultative process, setting out guidance and best \npractice in regard to industrial relations practice and compliance. \n\nThis statutory function fits within the WRC’s overall remit of promoting \nimprovement and maintenance of good workplace relations; promoting and \nencouraging compliance with relevant employment, equality and equal status \nlegislation and Codes of Practice; conducting reviews of, and monitoring \ndevelopments in, workplace relations generally. \n\nThe WRC’s core services reflect these functions and include early dispute \nresolution, mediation, conciliation, facilitation and advisory services, and \nadjudication on complaints and disputes. \n\nWhile failure to follow a Code prepared under the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 \nis not an offence in itself, Section 42 (4) provides that in any proceedings before \na Court, the Labour Court or the Workplace Relations Commission, a code of \npractice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the Code which \nappears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question \narising in the proceedings shall be taken into account

Where the organisation \n\ncan support this, it often helps to resolve matters earlier and more effectively. \n\nThe role of the Contact Person generally would be a supportive one: to listen, \n\nand offer guidance on options in line with company policy and procedures, \n\nall on a strictly confidential basis. This may not be practical for all \n\norganisations, however, where it is the chosen route, personnel for this role \n\nshould be carefully selected and trained. The main purpose of the role is \n\nsupportive listening and information provision. The Contact Person will have \n\nno role in the investigation of any complaints and should not be tasked with \n\nany further involvement in the details or right and wrongs of a complaint. \n\nEmployers may also utilise previously chosen ‘Designated Persons’ for roles \n\nwithin this arena, but as a Contact Person, they will thus have no role in \n\ninvestigations. \n\n \n \n \n \n\f4. \n\nIntervention in Workplace Bullying \n\n19 [674] \n\nResponding to a Workplace Bullying Complaint at the workplace \n\nEarly Intervention Matters \n\nAny complaint about, or awareness of, alleged bullying requires quick, calm \n\nand consistent attention. As a general principle, it is worth emphasising that \n\nearly intervention offers the best possible potential for a good outcome, \n\nparticularly regarding restoring workplace relationships. However, this does \n\nnot equate with a rushed approach. Each case should be treated on its own \n\nmerit. A matter that is protracted, for whatever reason, becomes more \n\ndifficult to resolve in a positive way. Set out hereunder is both an informal \n\nand formal procedure for dealing with a workplace bullying complaint. \n\nThe Value of Mediation \n\nMediation is an important consideration for resolving issues at an early stage. It \n\nis an informal voluntary process where an impartial and competent third party \n\nenables individuals to work through conflict or disagreement, with a view to \n\nimproving their relationship.

This collaborative and \n\nnon-adversarial approach is particularly important in situations where people \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f20 [674] \n\nmust continue to work together into the future. There are several elements to \n\na good informal process: \n\n• People being confident that they will be listened to, will be taken \n\nseriously and that their issues will be assessed fairly, quickly and \n\neffectively. \n\n• Managers having the confidence and capacity to engage on such \n\nissues and to respond and consult appropriately. \n\n• Confidentiality to be respected by all. \n\n• A focus always on the future workplace relationship and a problem-\n\nsolving orientation. \n\nAn informal approach may effectively address the unwanted behaviour \n\nwithout recourse to any other action. Sometimes the person who is alleged \n\nto be engaging in the behaviour is genuinely unaware that the behaviour \n\nbeing complained of is disrespectful or unwelcome or undermining and/or \n\ncausing distress. \n\nRecommended steps in an informal process are: \n\n• \n\nIn the first instance, the unacceptable behaviour/acts should be \n\nraised by the target employee (the person who feels bullied) with the \n\nperson involved but only if they feel comfortable in doing so. This \n\nshould be done quickly and calmly, focusing on the facts regarding \n\nacts done and their consequences. \n\n• \n\nIf it is more suitable, the individual who perceives that they are the \n\nrecipient of unacceptable behaviour should put their concerns in \n\nwriting, again focusing on the offending acts and their effects on \n\nthem. \n\n• Where an employee perceives that the concerns relate to an \n\nimmediate manager, the employee may wish to discuss the matter \n\ninformally with their manager’s manager or a person at the next \n\nlevel of management. \n\n• The employee may wish to avail of the support of a Contact Person, \n\nwhere applicable, for guidance and to get a copy of the Anti-\n\n \n \n \n \n\f21 [674] \n\nBullying Policy document. \n\n• The focus of the above is to seek to resolve the matter informally by \n\nagreement without recourse to any other step. An informal \n\ndiscussion is often sufficient to alert the person concerned to the \n\neffects of the behaviour alleged and can lead to a greater \n\nunderstanding and an agreement that the behaviour will stop. It can \n\nalso lead to an explanation of the original intention of the behaviour \n\nand/or an agreement to modify the behaviour. On the other hand, it \n\nmay be that the behaviour is valid and reasonable and the reaction \n\nof the offended party is at odds with the generally accepted \n\nunderstanding of the behaviour. \n\nIn the context of being aware of an allegation by an employee, and whether \n\nthe matter has been resolved, there may be value in the employer nominating \n\na person to review good practice generally in the workplace around dealing \n\nwith such matters. For example, an awareness campaign highlighting \n\nexamples of appropriate behaviour as well as improper behaviour and some \n\nexplanation of effects to be brought to everyone’s attention. \n\nA brief written record, in line with relevant data protection legislation, should \n\nbe kept of the matter and agreed outcomes and dates noted by the relevant \n\nperson responsible for managing the complaint. \n\nIn smaller organisations, the employer, or person heading that organisation, \n\nshould not try to informally resolve a complaint personally but should \n\ninstead refer the matter for resolution/management to a senior manager, or \n\nsuch other persons as may be agreed. This is to prevent any duplication of \n\nroles of the employer, should the issue be later on referred to them for a \n\njudgement/appeal. \n\nIn such organisations also, where internal structures are limited, if the complaint \n\nmade is against a senior person within the enterprise, it may be necessary to use \n\nthe expertise of an independent professional body to access mediation or \n\nconciliation or some other form of resolution. Such bodies may include the \n\nMediation Services of the WRC. Even in larger organisations, external \n\nassistance may be required in order to initiate an effective early solution. \n\n \n \n \n\f22 [674]", "text_norm": "4.1.1 initial informal process prompt informal problem-solving approach offer best potential addressing allegation bullying effectively collaborative non-adversarial approach particularly important situation people 20 674 must continue work together future several element good informal process people confident listened taken seriously issue assessed fairly quickly effectively manager confidence capacity engage issue respond consult appropriately confidentiality respected all focus always future workplace relationship problem- solving orientation informal approach may effectively address unwanted behaviour without recourse action sometimes person alleged engaging behaviour genuinely unaware behaviour complained disrespectful unwelcome undermining causing distress recommended step informal process first instance unacceptable behaviour act raised target employee (the person feel bullied) person involved feel comfortable so done quickly calmly focusing fact regarding act done consequence suitable individual perceives recipient unacceptable behaviour put concern writing focusing offending act effect them employee perceives concern relate immediate manager employee may wish discus matter informally manager manager person next level management employee may wish avail support contact person applicable guidance get copy anti- 21 674 bullying policy document focus seek resolve matter informally agreement without recourse step informal discussion often sufficient alert person concerned effect behaviour alleged lead greater understanding agreement behaviour stop also lead explanation original intention behaviour agreement modify behaviour hand may behaviour valid reasonable reaction offended party odds generally accepted understanding behaviour context aware allegation employee whether matter resolved may value employer nominating person review good practice generally workplace around dealing matter example awareness campaign highlighting example appropriate behaviour well improper behaviour explanation effect brought everyone attention brief written record line relevant data protection legislation kept matter agreed outcome date noted relevant person responsible managing complaint smaller organisation employer person heading organisation try informally resolve complaint personally instead refer matter resolution management senior manager person may agreed prevent duplication role employer issue later referred judgement appeal organisation also internal structure limited complaint made senior person within enterprise may necessary use expertise independent professional body access mediation conciliation form resolution body may include mediation service wrc even larger organisation external assistance may required order initiate effective early solution 22 674", "start_char": 29479, "end_char": 33781, "source_path": "downloads\\2020\\2020_0673.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "checksum": "sha256:4e221a631cc45367563716f59a57143bfc9b6df93db824ca576a363eb7a89fb1", "cross_refs": []}

This \n\nperson should not be \n\nthe Contact Person. They may be a \n\nsupervisor/manager or someone in authority within the organisation. \n\nFor each complaint that arises, such a person should be assigned to deal \n\nwith that particular case. This is a very important role and pivotal in \n\naltering bullying cultures and handling complaints effectively at the \n\ninformal stage. Effective guidance and training should be in place for \n\nthose who are engaged at this level with the process. \n\n• The complaint may be verbal or written. If verbal, a written note of what \n\nis complained of should be taken by the nominated person and a copy \n\ngiven to the complainant. \n\n• This nominated person (who may be a manager), managing the \n\ncomplaint, should then establish the facts, the context and then the next \n\ncourse of action in dealing with the matter under the informal procedure. \n\n• \n\nIf the complaint concerns alleged bullying as defined and includes \n\nconcrete examples of inappropriate behaviour, the person complained \n\nagainst should be presented with the complaint and their response \n\nestablished. \n\n• Thereafter a method should be agreed to progress the issue to resolution \n\nso that both parties can return to a harmonious working environment \n\nwithout bullying being a factor. \n\n• \n\nIf the behaviour complained of does not concern alleged bullying as \n\ndefined, an alternative approach should be put in place and a rationale \n\nrecorded. If there are no concrete examples given, it must be deemed \n\nthat there is no complaint to be answered by the person complained of \n\nas they have no recourse to repudiating an accusation that doesn’t give \n\n \n \n \n \n\f23 [674] \n\nany specifics. \n\n• Line managers should be kept informed, as appropriate, about the \n\nprocess in train. \n\n• Steps to stop the bullying behaviour, where it has been partly or fully \n\nidentified, and monitor the situation along specified lines should be \n\nimplemented with both parties. This may involve a direct or indirect \n\napproach and possible resolution through a programme to change \n\nbehaviour. It may also involve mediation by an agreed mediator who is \n\npractised in dealing with alleged bullying at work. \n\n• Enough time needs to be allowed for the mediation or on-going \n\nmonitoring process to be successful and behaviour change to be \n\nrealistically achieved over the longer term. It may be necessary to \n\nconsider if other working arrangements are required or feasible during \n\nthis short-term phase.

The \n\npurpose of the records, which do not include detail of discussions, is to \n\nprovide evidence of the complaint having been met with an \n\norganisational response and attempt at resolution.

However, interested parties can also seek \ninformation on the varying roles and scope of other organisations elsewhere. \n\nThe HSA operates under the statutory powers of the 2005 Act. Its purpose is to \nprovide protection for employees in all places of work in the Republic of Ireland. \nThe overarching tenet of the 2005 Act is to oversee the employer duty to ensure \neveryone at work is provided with a workplace and system of work which is, as \nfar as is reasonably practicable, free from risk to health and to safety. \n\nThere are, within the 2005 Act, specific duties on employers and others on \nemployees, to uphold and promote this standard, as well as a healthy and safe \nculture. There are provisions within the 2005 Act which are relevant to the issue \nof workplace bullying, both directly and/or indirectly.

This latter approach will \nbe recorded as a ‘Request for Information (RFI)’. \n\nThe WCU responds to RFIs by providing either a verbal or written answer to the \ncustomer, or, if they are not in a position to answer the query, they will forward \nthe RFI to an appropriate person who will respond. \n\nWhere a complaint is made concerning bullying, it can be classified in various \nways, depending on its content and the nature of the complaint.

An effective \npolicy, and a strong commitment to implementing it is required. The purpose of \nan effective policy is not simply to prevent improper conduct and behaviour but \nalso to encourage best practice and a safe and harmonious workplace where such \nbehaviour is unlikely to occur. \n\nEmployers should therefore adopt, implement and monitor a comprehensive, \neffective and accessible policy on bullying at work. \n\nPreparing the Policy \n\nStrategies to create and maintain a working environment in which the dignity \nand respect of employees are appreciated and upheld are most likely to be \neffective when they are jointly agreed. In this way, employers and other parties to \nthe employment relationship can create an anti-bullying culture and share a sense \nof responsibility for that culture. In very small businesses which may not have \nan employee representative structure, the policy and strategy should be advised \nto all employees. \n\nThe policy and complaints procedure should be adopted, where appropriate, \ninsofar as is practicable with clients, customers and other business contacts after \nconsultation or negotiation with trade union or employee representatives, on its \ncontent and implementation. Simple direct language should be used in the policy. \nInformation given to employees should be in a form, manner and, as appropriate, \nlanguage that is reasonably likely to be understood by the employees concerned. \n\nThe policy document should be written, dated and signed by a responsible person \nat senior management level and updated when appropriate, for example following \na change that might impact the validity of the original risk assessment. \n\nAs required under safety and health laws and in keeping with normal industrial \nrelations practice, there should be prior consultation, and participation where \nappropriate, regarding the policy and its implementation, with employees or their \nrepresentatives, including the Safety Representative or the Safety Committee. \n\nThe policy should set out a complaints procedure as recommended within this \nCode. \n\nIt is prudent to keep a record of consultation actions in case of future \nrequirement. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f36 [674] \n\nCore Elements and Implementation Steps \n\nEmployer’s declaration \n\nThe Anti-Bullying Policy should declare: \n\n• the employer’s commitment to ensuring that the place of work is free \nfrom bullying at work and that the work environment is aimed at \nproviding a high quality product or service in an atmosphere of respect, \ncollaboration, openness, safety and equality; \n\n• that all employees have the right to be treated with dignity and respect \n\nat work; \n\n• that the risk of bullying has been assessed and preventive measures \n\nincluded, where necessary, in the Safety Statement; \n\n• that consultation with employees or their representatives, including the \nSafety Representative and the Safety Committee, as appropriate, has \ntaken place as regards the risk of bullying at work and preventive \nmeasures; \n\n• that human resource management policies and practices will strive to \n\nprevent bullying at work; \n\n• that the policy will be updated to reflect the company’s experiences in \nimplementing it, relevant changes in the workplace and any external \nfactors that are relevant; \n\n• that employees also have responsibility in creating and contributing to \nthe maintenance of a work environment free from bullying or from \nconduct likely to contribute to bullying; \n\n• that complaints by employees of bullying at work will be treated with \nfairness, sensitivity, respect and confidentiality for all parties \nconcerned; \n\n• that a person or persons alleged to have bullied will be afforded natural \njustice and treated with fairness, sensitivity and respecting the need for \nconfidentiality with all parties concerned; \n\n• that bullying at work by the employer, by employees and by nonemployees, such as clients, customers, sub-contractors and business \ncontacts, will not be tolerated and the appropriate employing \norganisation should deal with the complaint in line with these \nprocedures, which could lead to disciplinary procedures being applied; \n\n• that following the application of the disciplinary procedure, if a \nvexatious complaint of bullying is substantiated it may result in \ndisciplinary sanction; and \n\n• NOTE: Should disciplinary procedures be initiated following on from \na bullying investigation, those procedures would fall outside the scope \nof this Code. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f[674] 37 \n\nScope \n\nThe policy should \n\n• describe what is meant by bullying at work as set out above under What \n\nis bullying at work?; \n\n• include a non-exhaustive list of examples of bullying behaviour \n\nrelevant to the particular employment; \n\n• give the name or job title of the person who may be approached by a \n\nperson wishing to complain of bullying at work; \n\n• state that the protection extends to; \n\n• bullying at work by management, fellow employees, \nsubordinates, clients, customers and other business contacts; \n\n• beyond the place of work to off-site and to work-related social \n\nevents \n\n• state that all complaints of bullying will be taken seriously and will be \nfollowed through to resolution and that employees who make a \ncomplaint will not be victimised; \n\nAllocation of responsibilities as regards prevention of bullying at work \n\nThe policy should state that management, others in positions of authority and \nworkplace representatives have a particular responsibility to ensure that bullying \nat work does not occur and that complaints are addressed promptly. The policy \nshould state that in particular, management should: \n\n• provide good example by treating all in the place of work with courtesy \n\nand respect; \n\n• promote awareness of the policy and complaints procedures; \n\n• be vigilant for signs of bullying at work through observation and \nthrough seeking employee feedback and take action before a problem \nescalates; \n\n• deal sensitively with employees involved in a bullying complaint \n\nwhether as complainant or alleged bully; \n\n• explain the procedures to be followed if a complaint of bullying at work \n\nis made; \n\n• ensure that an employee making a complaint is not victimised for doing \n\nso; and \n\n• monitor and follow up the situation after a complaint is made so that \n\nthe bullying at work does not recur. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f38 [674] \n\nTrade Unions \n\nThe policy should address the contribution to be made by the trade union/s, as \nappropriate, including as regards the prevention of bullying in the workplace \nthrough their participation in the development and implementation of policies \nand procedures, through their information and training services, and through the \ncollective bargaining process. Trade unions may also play a role in providing \ninformation, advice and representation to employees who have been bullied at \nwork, and to employees against whom allegations of bullying at work have been \nmade. \n\nEmployees \n\nThe policy should indicate that employees can contribute to achieving a work \nenvironment which does not tolerate bullying at work. This could also include \nco-operating with preventive measures introduced by management, and also \nthrough trade union strategies to eliminate or avoid bullying at work. Employees \nshould recognise that if an investigator finds facts which evidence bullying at \nwork, the matter may be dealt with through the disciplinary procedure. Equally \nif the investigator finds facts which evidence a vexatious complaint, this may \nalso be dealt with through the disciplinary procedure. \n\nNon-Employees \n\nThe policy should indicate that bullying at work by non-employees such as \nclients, customers and business contacts is not tolerated and may lead to \ntermination of contracts or suspension of services, or to exclusion from a premises \nor the imposition of other sanctions, as appropriate. \n\nCommunication of Policy \n\nThe policy should include a commitment to effective communication of the \npolicy. It should be communicated effectively to all those potentially affected by \nit, including management, employees, customers, clients and other business \ncontacts, such as those who supply and receive goods and services. Effective \nmeans of communicating a policy could include newsletters, training manuals, \ntraining courses, leaflets, websites, emails, toolbox talks and notice boards. \n\nCommunication to Employees \n\nNew employees, including those in management and all other positions of \nresponsibility, should be made aware of the policy as part of any formal induction \nprocess to familiarise them with their job and their working environment and \nany rules and regulations that apply. \n\nWhere a staff handbook is distributed to employees as part of the induction \nprocess, the Anti-Bullying Policy should be included. \n\nExisting employees should receive updated and regular communication on the \npolicy. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[674] 39 \n\nCommunication to Non-Employees \n\nA summary of the Anti-Bullying Policy should be prominently displayed where \nappropriate and as identified on the risk assessment, such as at places where \nmembers of the public, clients, and customers attend. \n\nMonitoring \n\nThe policy should include a commitment to monitoring and recording incidents \nof bullying at work. \n\nStatistics and information gathered from such monitoring should be recorded and \nused to assist the employer take corrective action or achieve continuous \nimprovement in their bullying prevention policy and procedure. \n\nTraining and Supervision \n\nEmployees should be provided with such information, training, development and \nsupervision as is necessary to ensure the prevention of bullying. This should \ninclude: \n\n• making employees aware of the Anti-Bullying Policy; \n\n• information on the appropriate behaviour to comply with the terms of \n\nthe policy; \n\n• training, if needed, in order to comply with the policy; and \n\n• assistance, if necessary, to overcome a bullying incident, as well as \n\nadequate and informed supervision of the work environment. \n\nThe policy should include commitments to staff training and supervision as \nidentified in the risk assessment on issues related to bullying at work, including \nthe provision of training for managers, supervisors and for all staff, at induction \nor through appropriate awareness raising initiatives. Such training should identify \nthe factors which contribute to a working environment free of bullying and \nfamiliarise participants with their responsibilities under the policy and any \nproblems they are likely to encounter. \n\nSuch training is especially important for those members of staff responsible for \nsupervision and for implementing the policy and responding to complaints. \n\nBest practice would ensure that records are kept by the employer of all such \ntraining. \n\nReviews \n\nThe policy should include a commitment to review on a regular basis in line with \nexperience in the employment, changes in the law, relevant case law or other \ndevelopments. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f40 [674] \n\nA responsible person should be named in the policy to ensure that monitoring, \ntraining and reviews take place. \n\n \n \n \n \n\f[674] 41 \n\nExtracts from the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nSection 8: General duties of employer", "text_norm":
