The relevant details of the assentors must be included on the \nstatutory declarations - number (and polling district letters) on the register \nof Dáil electors, address on the register, contact details, the relevant Dáil \nconstituency on the date of assent where he or she is registered, the name \nand address of the candidate, and the form of prescribed photographic ID \nproduced, and any identifying number on it. \n\nEach assentor MUST, when making the statutory declaration, bring one of \nthe following photographic documents for identification purposes: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\npassport, \n\ndriving licence, \n\nemployee identity card containing a photograph, \n\nstudent identity card issued by an educational institution and \ncontaining a photograph, \n\na travel document containing name and photograph, or \n\na Public Services Card \n\n \n \n\f8 [372] \n\nOne of the documents MUST be produced to the person taking the \nstatutory declaration. \n\nAn assent is valid in respect of the constituency in which the assentor’s \naddress is located at the general or bye-election to which the nomination \nform relates.
