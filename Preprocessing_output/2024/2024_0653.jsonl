The increases in the disregard will take effect from 3 July 2025. \n\nThese Regulations also correct a misalignment in the current text of article 167 \nwhich relates to eligibility for the Carer’s Support Grant in circumstances where \nthe person being cared for is undergoing medical or other treatment of a \ntemporary nature in an institution. The effect of the revised alignment is to \nprovide clarity that the 13-week period applies to both of subparagraphs (i) and \n(ii) of Article 167(b) and confirms, in line with article 56(a) as respects Carer’s \nBenefit, and article 136(1)(a) as respects Carer’s allowance, that a carer \ncontinues to qualify for receipt of the Carer’s Support Grant for any period or \nperiods not exceeding 13 weeks in a year where the person being cared for \nundergoes medical or other treatment of a temporary nature in an institution, or \nis temporarily being cared for, or temporarily residing with another person. \nFinally, the Regulations also update the titles of the relevant Departments \nconcerned. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f6 [653] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€ 3.00 \n\n(DEASP-223) 30. 11/24.
