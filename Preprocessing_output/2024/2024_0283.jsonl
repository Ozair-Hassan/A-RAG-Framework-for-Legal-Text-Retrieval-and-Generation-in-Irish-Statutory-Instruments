The Local Government (Expenses of Local Authority Members)", "text_raw": "2. The Local Government (Expenses of Local Authority Members) \n\nRegulations 2021 (S.I. No. 313 of 2021) are hereby amended by: \n\n(a) \n\nthe substitution of the following for regulation 6: \n\n“6. (1) Except in any year where local elections are held, an amount \nof not more than €5,160 per annum is payable to a member in respect of \neligible expenses (other than expenses provided for elsewhere in these \nRegulations) which the member is obliged to incur in the performance of \nhis or her duties as a member, and where evidence in the form of vouchers \nor receipts is available to show that the expenses were incurred, except for \nan amount of not more than €80 per month which may be used for \nincidental expenditure without evidence in the form of vouchers or \nreceipts. \n\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), where in any year a person is a \nmember of a local authority for a period less than the full year, the \nmaximum annual amount of the local representation allowance payable to \nthat member shall be reduced, and calculated on a pro rata basis. \n\n(3) A local authority shall decide, by the end of the calendar year, to \npay the vouched portion of this allowance to councillors in the following \nyear: \n\n(a) \n\nin arrears, on the basis of vouched expenditure made in \nadvance of payment and subject to the provision of \nevidence of such expenditure as required in such directions \nas the Minister may give under Regulation 17, up to a \nmaximum of €350 per month; or, \n\n(b) \n\nin advance of expenditure, in anticipation of the subsequent \nprovision of appropriate evidence of expenditure incurred \nat such intervals as stipulated in such directions as the \n\nNotice of the making of this Statutory Instrument was published in \n\"Iris Oifigiúil\" of 14th June, 2024. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f[283] 3 \n\nMinister may give under Regulation 17, up to a maximum \nof €350 per month. \n\n(4) Where a local authority decides to pay the local representation \nallowance to members in advance, per paragraph 3(b), the local authority \nshall put in place the necessary arrangements for individual members who \nwish to be paid in arrears. \n\n(5) Should a local authority decide to pay the vouched portion of this \nallowance in arrears in accordance with paragraph (3)(a) and (4) that local \nauthority shall make provision to facilitate the pre-payment of single, \nlarger eligible expenses, in whole or in part, subject to the maximum \namount under (1). \n\n(6) Should a local authority decide to pay the vouched portion of this \nallowance in advance, in accordance with paragraph (3)(b), each member \nof that local authority shall on an annual basis provide written notification \nto his or her local authority of the monthly amount that he or she wants to \nreceive in equal instalments during the year subject to the maximum \nannual amount set out in (1) not being exceeded. \n\n(7) \n\n(a) Where in any year a member attends less than the relevant \nnumber of meetings, the amount of the local representation \nallowance to be paid to the member shall be the proportion \nof the sum determined in accordance with paragraphs (1) to \n(4) of the Regulations as is equal to the proportion of the \nrelevant number of meetings which the member attended \nduring the year or portion of the year concerned. \n\n(b) For the purposes of this Regulation, ‘relevant number of \n\nmeetings’ means fifty per cent of the sum of: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe total number of meetings of the local authority and \nthe relevant municipal district members held during \nthe year or portion of the year concerned; and \n\nthe total number of meetings of committees, joint \ncommittees and joint policing committees of which \nthe person is a member held during the year or portion \nof the year concerned. \n\n(8) \n\nIf additional expenditure is incurred by a member in excess of the \namount claimed for under paragraph (6) at the start of that year then he or \nshe may apply to his or her local authority, before 1 December each year, \nfor a supplementary payment equivalent to the differential between actual \nexpenditure incurred and the total amount received to date under paragraph \n(6) subject to the maximum annual amount set out in paragraphs (1) and \n(2) not being exceeded. \n\n(9) Each member who seeks to claim an amount under paragraphs \n(1), (2) and (3)(a) and (4) shall, subject to and, in accordance with such \ndirections as the Minister may give under Regulation 17, submit evidence \nin the form of vouchers and receipts to show that the expenses have been \nincurred in advance of receiving payment. \n\n \n\f4 [283] \n\n(10) Each member who is paid an amount under paragraph (1), (2) and \n(3)(b) shall, in accordance with such directions as the Minister may give \nunder Regulation 17, retain evidence in the form of invoices and receipts \nto show that the expenses were incurred. \n\n(11) Expenses under the local representation allowance shall not be \nclaimed by a member or payable by a local authority for which expenses \npayments are separately made to that member by another body. \n\n(12) (a) Should a local authority decide to pay the vouched portion \nof this allowance in advance, in accordance with paragraph \n(3)(b), that local authority shall conduct a quarterly review \nof each member’s submitted vouchers and receipts along \nwith his or her expenditure and advise a member where he \nor she has incurred less expenditure than he or she has \nclaimed under the local representation allowance. \n\n(b) Following a quarterly review, the local authority may, in \nconsultation with the member, review remaining payments \nunder that allowance to that member with the aim that no \noverpayment results by year end. \n\n(c) Where a quarterly review identifies that an overpayment is \ndue to be repaid by a person who ceases to be a member of \nthe local authority during the review period, the local \nauthority shall issue a written notice to him or her requiring \nhim or her to enter into an arrangement with the local \nauthority within one month of having received the written \nnotice to repay the amount, with the full repayment to be \nmade as soon as possible. \n\n(13) Each member who is paid expenses under paragraphs (1) to (6) \nshall, no later than 1 February of each year, provide to his or her local \nauthority a written certification of expenditure incurred during the \npreceding year in such form as set out in directions the Minister may give \nunder Regulation 17. \n\n(14) Where a member has: \n\n(a) \n\nIncurred less eligible expenditure at the end of a year than \nthe total amount of monthly payments under paragraph 3(b) \nthat he or she received during that year under paragraph (6); \nor, \n\n(b) Received a supplementary payment under paragraph (8) \nthat is in excess of the total eligible expenditure incurred by \nhim or her by year end, \n\nthen he or she shall refund the differential between the amount received \nand the total eligible expenditure incurred to his or her local authority. \n\n(15) Where a refund for overpayment is payable under paragraph (14) \n\na member shall either: \n\n \n\f[283] 5 \n\n(a) \n\nrepay the amount to the local authority no later than 1 \nFebruary of the year following that in which the \noverpayment was incurred; or \n\n(b) notify his or her local authority in writing no later than 1 \nFebruary of the year following that in which the \noverpayment was incurred that he or she wishes to receive \na reduction to subsequent payments received under \nparagraphs (1) and (2) until such time as the amount of the \noverpayment has been refunded. \n\n(16) Where, after 1 February, a local authority becomes aware of an \noverpayment having been made to a member and arrangements for a \nrefund have not been made by the member under paragraph (15), then the \nlocal authority shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nissue a written notice to the member, requiring him or her \nto enter into an arrangement with the local authority within \none month of having received the written notice to repay \nthe amount, with the full repayment to be made as soon as \npossible; or \n\nissue a written notice to the member informing him or her \nthat a reduction to subsequent payments made to the \nmember under paragraphs (1) to (4) will be applied until \nsuch time as the amount of the overpayment has been \nrefunded and that this period of reduced payments will \ncommence one month after the issuing of the written \nnotice.” \n\nThe Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and \nReform consents to the making of the foregoing Regulations. \n\nGIVEN under my Official Seal, \n\n5 June, 2024. \n\nPASCHAL DONOHOE, \n\nMinister for Public Expenditure, National Development \nPlan Delivery and Reform. \n\nGIVEN under my hand, \n
