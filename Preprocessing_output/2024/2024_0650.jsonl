The hyperlink: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/habitatsdirective/index_en.ht\nm which connects to the European Commission Environment (Nature and \nBiodiversity) website also contains a further link to the text of the Habitats \nDirective. \n\nThe effect of these Regulations is to complete the formal designation of the site \nas a Special Area of Conservation in accordance with Article 4 of the Directive. \nThe geographical area of the Special Area of Conservation designated by these \nRegulations is defined in Schedule 1 (a map of the area) and Schedule 2 (a list \nof the townlands in question or a description of the area). For more detailed \nmaps than those contained in Schedule 1, or for greater detail on boundary \ndelineation, contact should be made with the National Parks and Wildlife Service \nof the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or by viewing \nthe relevant text or map details on www.npws.ie. \n\nThe natural habitat types and animal and plant species lists cited in Schedule 3 \nof these Regulations are specified, in accordance with the Directive, in order to \nensure their conservation (i.e. the measures required to maintain or restore the \nnatural habitats and the populations of species of wild fauna and flora at a \nfavourable status). The updated list of published conservation objectives referred \nto in Regulation 3 is available on www.npws.ie. Public authorities should have \nregard to these objectives when undertaking a screening or appropriate \nassessment of plans or projects in accordance with the EU Habitats Directive. \n\nThose activities that require consent of the Minister or in some circumstances \nanother public authority listed at Schedule 4 to these Regulations are cited for \ntheir potential to cause disturbance or damage to the natural habitat types and \nanimal and plant species specified in Schedule 3 of these Regulations. \nLandowners or occupiers should contact the local National Parks and Wildlife \nService office of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage \nbefore undertaking any of the works listed at Schedule 4. (See www.npws.ie for \ncontact details). Please note that activities other than those listed at Schedule 4 \nto these Regulations, such as effluent discharge, construction work, aquaculture, \nfishing or forestry require a licence or permission from the appropriate consent \nauthority. \n\nThese Regulations provide (Regulations 6 and 7) that contravention of the \nprovisions of these Regulations shall constitute an offence.
