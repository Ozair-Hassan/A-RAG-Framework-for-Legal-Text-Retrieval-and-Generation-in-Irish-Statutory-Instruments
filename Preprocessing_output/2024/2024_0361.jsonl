This means that the construction of a dwelling \nhouse, the subject of a planning exemption, does not require a commencement \nnotice. \n\nAmendments to the planning code in 2022 to address the urgent need to provide \nemergency accommodation or support to persons seeking international \nprotection, including those displaced by the conflict in Ukraine, exempted \ncertain buildings, including new dwelling houses, from planning control. In \naddition, Section 179A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended \nwas commenced in March 2023 to assist local authorities in the delivery of \nhousing developments on State lands zoned to include residential. Section 179A \nof the Act removed the requirement for local authorities to undertake the ‘Part \n8’ local authority own development process [section 179 of the Act] where the \nproposed housing development met the criteria of section 179A of the Act. In \naddition, section 4(1)(fa) was commenced in tandem with section 179A of the \nAct to provide that development under section 179A of the Act was classed as \nexempted development under the Act. \n\nAs a result of these changes to the Planning Acts, exempting certain \ndevelopment, the requirement to submit a Commencement Notice and any \nassociated provisions under the Building Control Regulations 1997 – 2021, for \nthe commencement of works relating to new dwellings were removed. \n\nThese Regulations re-instate the obligation to submit a commencement notice \nand follow building control processes for the construction of a dwelling house, \nregardless of planning exempted development status. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f[361] 5 \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€ 3.00 \n\n(BDDHPLG-24) 30. 7/24.
