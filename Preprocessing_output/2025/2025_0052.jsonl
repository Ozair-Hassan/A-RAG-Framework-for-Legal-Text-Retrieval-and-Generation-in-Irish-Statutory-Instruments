of the point source; \n\n \n \n \n\f(b) where a body is subject to a number of point source pressures \nmonitoring points may be selected to assess the magnitude and \nimpact of these pressures as a

\nsource pressures, and of the relative risks of the failure to achieve \ngood surface water status; \n\nfor bodies at risk from significant hydromorphological pressure, \nsufficient monitoring points

to assess the impact of the pressures referred to in subarticle (1), \n\nthe EPA shall monitor the following as relevant: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nparameters indicative of the biological quality element, or \nelements, most sensitive to the pressures to which the water \nbodies are subject, \n\nall priority substances discharged, and other pollutants discharged \nin significant quantities, \n\nparameters indicative of the hydromorphological quality element \nmost sensitive to the pressure identified. \n\nDesign of investigative monitoring: objective \n\n10H. \n\nInvestigative monitoring shall be carried out— \n\n(a) where the reason for any exceedances is unknown, \n\n(b) where surveillance monitoring indicates that the objectives set out \nin Article 4 of the Directive for a body of water are not likely to \nbe achieved and operational monitoring has not already been \nestablished, in order to ascertain the causes of a water body or \nwater bodies failing to achieve the environmental objectives, or \n\n(c) \n\nto ascertain the magnitude and impacts of accidental pollution, \n\n \n \n \n\f10 [52] \n\nand shall inform the establishment of a programme of measures for the \nachievement of the environmental objectives and specific measures necessary to \nremedy the effects of accidental pollution. \n\nFrequency of investigative monitoring \n\n10I (1) For the surveillance monitoring period, the frequencies for \nmonitoring parameters indicative of physico-chemical quality elements in the \nTable shall be applied unless greater intervals would be justified on the basis of \ntechnical knowledge and expert judgement. \n\n(2) For biological or hydromorphological quality elements monitoring shall \n\nbe carried out at least once during the surveillance monitoring period. \n\n(3) For operational monitoring, the frequency of monitoring required for any \nparameter shall be determined by the EPA so as to provide sufficient data for a \nreliable assessment of the status of the relevant quality element. \n\n(4) As a guideline, monitoring shall take place at intervals not exceeding \nthose shown in the Table unless greater intervals would be justified on the basis \nof technical knowledge and expert judgement. \n\n(5) The frequency of monitoring shall— \n\n(a) be chosen so as to achieve an acceptable level of confidence and \n\nprecision, and \n\n(b) be selected which take account of the variability in parameters \nresulting from both natural and anthropogenic conditions. \n\n(6) Estimates of the confidence and precision attained by the monitoring \n\nsystem used shall be stated in the river basin management plan. \n\n(7) The times at which monitoring is undertaken shall be selected so as to \nminimise the impact of seasonal variation on the results, and thus ensure that the \nresults reflect changes in the water body as a result of changes due to \nanthropogenic pressure. \n\n(8) Additional monitoring during different seasons of the same year shall be \n\ncarried out, where necessary, to achieve the objective set out in subarticle (7). \n\nQuality element \n\nRivers \n\nLakes \n\nTransitional Coastal \n\nBiological
