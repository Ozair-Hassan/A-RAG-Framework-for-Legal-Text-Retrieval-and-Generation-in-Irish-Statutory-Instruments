In this context, Council Directive (EU) 2020/285 introduced the special \nscheme for small enterprises (hereinafter ‘SME scheme’), in Title XII, Chapter \n1, of the VAT Directive, designed to ease the burden of compliance on SMEs in \ndealing with VAT through the application of the VAT exemption on the supplies \nof goods and services, resulting in less compliance work. \n\nThis set of Regulations transposes Council Directive 2020/285 into Irish law by \nway of inserting new provisions in a new Chapter 5 of Part 10, and consequential \namendments to sections 2, 5, 6, 59, 60, and 80 – into the Value-Added Tax \nConsolidation Act 2010 (No. 31 of 2010). Under the new provisions, subject to \ncertain conditions, small enterprises may avail of SME schemes in EU member \nstates other than where they are established (hereinafter ‘cross border SME \nscheme’). The consequential amendments amend the approach to assessing the \neligibility of small enterprises established in Ireland to avail of the scheme in \nIreland. \n\nRegulation 1 gives the title of the Regulations. \n\nRegulation 2 defines, for the purposes of these Regulations, the Act of 2010 as \nmeaning the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010. \n\nRegulation 3 inserts a new definition of annual turnover used for assessing VAT \nthresholds and inserts a new subparagraph in paragraph 4A of section 2 that \nreferences a new Part 3 in Schedule 9 which removes Northern Ireland from the \ndefinition of a Member State for the operation of the SME scheme. \n\nRegulation 4 amends section 5 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 \nto align it with the new approach to assessing eligibility for availing of VAT \nthresholds. \n\nRegulation 5 amends section 6 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 \nto provide for a new approach to assessing the eligibility for availing of VAT \nthresholds. \n\nRegulation 6 deletes a reference to section 5(2) as a consequence of Regulation", "text_norm": "explanatory note (this note part instrument purport legal interpretation.) regulation transpose irish vat law council directive (eu) 2020 285 amends council directive 2006 112 ec (hereinafter vat directive ) common system value-added tax growth cross border trade small enterprise bear proportionally higher compliance cost large business due limited resource available complexity difference national vat system context council directive (eu) 2020 285 introduced special scheme small enterprise (hereinafter sme scheme ) title xii chapter 1 vat directive designed ease burden compliance smes dealing vat application vat exemption supply good service resulting le compliance work set regulation transpose council directive 2020 285 irish law way inserting new provision new chapter 5 part 10 consequential amendment section 2 5 6 59 60 80 - value-added tax consolidation act 2010 (no 31 2010) new provision subject certain condition small enterprise may avail sme scheme eu member state established (hereinafter cross border sme scheme ) consequential amendment amend approach assessing eligibility small enterprise established ireland avail scheme ireland regulation 1 give title regulation regulation 2 defines purpose regulation act 2010 meaning value-added tax consolidation act 2010 regulation 3 insert new definition annual turnover used assessing vat threshold insert new subparagraph paragraph 4a section 2 reference new part 3 schedule 9 remove northern ireland definition member state operation sme scheme regulation 4 amends section 5 value-added tax consolidation act 2010 align new approach assessing eligibility availing vat threshold regulation 5 amends section 6 value-added tax consolidation act 2010 provide new approach assessing eligibility availing vat threshold regulation 6 deletes reference section 5(2) consequence regulation", "start_char": 17557, "end_char": 20048, "source_path": "downloads\\2025\\2025_0069.pdf", "extraction_method": "pdfminer", "checksum": "sha256:e887c9eefc77ee583e79dfa35a095b5a6d4c055237e41c91e7cb742928033ce3", "cross_refs": []}
