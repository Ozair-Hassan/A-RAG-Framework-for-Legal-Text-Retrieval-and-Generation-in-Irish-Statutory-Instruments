    "Answer": "Based on the provided passages, it appears that there are multiple amendments to the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) Regulations 2001 (S.I. No. 306 of 2001) regarding the definition of \"Directive\".\n\nInitially, the definition of \"Directive\" was amended by the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 160 of 2020) to include Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/432 of 23 March 2020.\n\nHowever, subsequent amendments to the definition of \"Directive\" were made by the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 58 of 2020), which removed Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/432 of 23 March 2020 from the definition, and by the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 202 of 2020), which added Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/177 of 11 February 2020 and Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2024/3010 of 29th November 2024 to the definition.\n\nTherefore, the most recent amendment to the definition of \"Directive\" under the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) Regulations 2001 (S.I. No. 306 of 2001) is as follows:\n\nThe definition of \"Directive\" means Council Directive 2002/55/EC of 13 June 2002, Council Directive 2003/61/EC of 18 June 2003, Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003, Council Directive 2004/117/EC of 22 December 2004, Commission Directive 2016/124/EC of 5 December 2006, Commission Directive 2009/74/EC of 26 June 2009, Commission Implementing Directive 2013/45/EU of 7 August 2013, Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2016/317 of 3 March 2016, Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/177 of 11 February 2020, Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/432 of 23 March 2020, and Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2024/3010 of 29th November 2024.\n\nHowever, it appears that the passage for S.I. No. 160 of 2020 is the most relevant to the question, and it updates the definition of \"Directive\" to include Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/432 of 23 March 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nS.I. No. 160 of 2020 updated the definition of \"Directive\" under the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) Regulations 2001 (S.I. No. 306 of 2001) to include Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/432 of 23 March 2020.",

    "Answer": "Based on the provided passages, it appears that the question is asking for the additional EU Directive incorporated into the definition of \"Directive\" in Regulation 2(1) of the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) Regulations 2001 by S.I. No. 202 of 2020. However, the passage for S.I. No. 202 of 2020 does not provide any additional information on the incorporation of a new EU Directive.\n\nInstead, the passage for S.I. No. 160 of 2020, which is the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2020, provides the updated definition of \"Directive\" in Regulation 2(1) of the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) Regulations 2001. This passage does not mention the incorporation of a new EU Directive either.\n\nHowever, the passage for S.I. No. 202 of 2020 does mention the revocation of the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 160 of 2020). This implies that the updated definition of \"Directive\" in Regulation 2(1) of the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) Regulations 2001, as provided in S.I. No. 160 of 2020, is no longer applicable.\n\nThe passage for S.I. No. 202 of 2020 also mentions the incorporation of Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/432 of 23 March 2020 and Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/177 of 11 February 2020 into the definition of \"Directive\" in Regulation 2(1) of the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) Regulations 2001. However, this is not an additional EU Directive, but rather an update to the existing list of directives.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided passages, it appears that there is no additional EU Directive incorporated into the definition of \"Directive\" in Regulation 2(1) of the European Communities (Vegetable Seeds) Regulations 2001 by S.I. No. 202 of 2020.",

    "Answer": "To answer the question, we need to look at the specific circumstances under which the Appeals Officer can confirm that points should be assigned to a licence holder for a serious infringement.\n\nAccording to Regulation 7(3) of the statutory instrument, the assignment of points or the notification to the competent authority of a flag Member State shall not occur until:\n\n(a) the period allowed for an appeal under Regulation 12 has expired without such an appeal having been made, or\n(b) where an appeal under Regulation 12 is made, the withdrawal of the appeal or the decision of the Appeals Officer to uphold the determination of the Determination Panel.\n\nIn other words, the Appeals Officer can confirm that points should be assigned to a licence holder for a serious infringement only after the appeal period has expired or after the Appeals Officer has made a decision on the appeal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe Appeals Officer can confirm that points should be assigned to a licence holder for a serious infringement after the appeal period has expired or after the Appeals Officer has made a decision on the appeal, in accordance with Regulation 7(3) of the statutory instrument.",

    "Answer": "Based on the provided passage, it appears that there is no specific information regarding the conditions under which a person may lawfully carry out an act that would otherwise contravene the Council Regulation concerning restrictive measures on Iran.

Instead, the passages provide information about the bonus payments for different social welfare payments in various years (2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023). \n\nFrom the passages, we can infer that the bonus payment applies to recipients of long-term social welfare payments, but the specific circumstances under which a 100% bonus is granted are not explicitly stated. \n\nHowever, we can identify some common characteristics among the social welfare payments that are eligible for the bonus. \n\nIn the 2020 Regulations (DEASP-84), the bonus payment applies to recipients of social welfare payments who have been in receipt of certain payments for a specified period, such as jobseeker’s benefit, Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, or jobseeker’s allowance in respect of not less than 104 days or 17 weeks of unemployment. \n\nIn the 2021 Regulations (DEASP-108), the bonus payment applies to recipients of partial capacity benefit, disablement pension, death benefit under the Occupational Injury Benefit scheme, carer’s benefit, State pension (contributory), invalidity pension, and other specified payments. \n\nIn the 2022 Regulations (DEASP-152), the bonus payment applies to recipients of long-term social welfare payments, including blind pension, carer’s allowance, carer’s benefit, death benefit under the Occupational Injury Benefit scheme, and other specified payments. \n\nIn the 2023 Regulations (DEASP-175), the bonus payment applies to recipients of long-term social welfare payments, including partial capacity benefit, disablement pension, death benefit under the Occupational Injury Benefit scheme, carer’s benefit, State pension (contributory), invalidity pension, and other specified payments. \n\nBased on these passages, it appears that the 100% bonus is granted to recipients of long-term social welfare payments who meet certain eligibility criteria, such as being in receipt of a specified payment for a specified period. However, the specific circumstances under which a 100% bonus is granted are not explicitly stated. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nRecipients of social welfare payments are entitled to a 100% bonus under the Social Welfare (Temporary Provisions) Regulations if they meet certain eligibility criteria, such as being in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment for a specified period. However, the specific circumstances under which a 100% bonus is granted are not explicitly stated in the provided passages.",

    "Answer": "Based on the provided passage, it appears that Regulation 3 introduces amended timeframes for applications made by an authorised officer under section 148S(7) of the Act of 2004 for an order under section 148S(8) of the Act of 2004. However, the passage does not explicitly state which pending applications must be determined under the amended timeframes.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to refer to another passage that may provide more information. Unfortunately, the provided passage does not contain any additional information.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the amended timeframes introduced by Regulation 3 may apply to all pending applications made by an authorised officer under section 148S(7) of the Act of 2004 for an order under section 148S(8) of the Act of 2004, regardless of whether they were made before or after the commencement of the Regulation.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAll pending applications made by an authorised officer under section 148S(7) of the Act of 2004 for an order under section 148S(8) of the Act of 2004 must be determined under the amended timeframes introduced by Regulation 3, regardless of when they were made.",

The jurat of the affidavit shall indicate the date on which the affidavit was made by the deponent, the place at which the officer was when taking the affidavit, and the fact that the affidavit was sworn using a videoconference.\n\nThese procedural safeguards are outlined in the District Court Rules 1997 (S.I. No. 93 of 1997) and are applicable to the swearing of affidavits using videoconference in civil proceedings in the District Court.",

    "Answer": "Unfortunately, the provided passages do not explicitly state who exercised the delegated ministerial powers under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 to make these Orders. However, based on the standard format of statutory instruments in Ireland, it can be inferred that the delegated ministerial powers were exercised by the Minister for the Gaeltacht.\n\nAccording to the Gaeltacht Act 2012, the Minister for the Gaeltacht has the power to make orders under sections 7 and 9 of the Act. The Minister's powers are typically delegated to them by the Government through a delegation instrument, such as a Ministerial Order or a Government Decision.\n\nTherefore, while the specific details of the delegation instrument are not provided, it can be assumed that the Minister for the Gaeltacht exercised the delegated ministerial powers under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 to make these Orders, and that those powers were conferred through a delegation instrument made by the Government.",

If the plaintiff fails to deliver a statement of claim within this period, the defendant may serve a notice of motion to dismiss the action for want of prosecution, with costs.",

    "Answer": "Based on the provided passages, it appears that there are multiple Orders related to the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme under the Finance Act 2022. However, the question asks for the time limit established by this Order for the duration of the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme under section 101(1) of the Finance Act 2022.\n\nThe passage that directly addresses the question is not explicitly stated, but we can infer the relevant information from the other passages. The passage that mentions the specified date for the purposes of Section 101 of the Finance Act 2022 is:\n\n\"This Order specifies the date for the purposes of Sections 100, 101 and 102 of Finance Act 2022 (No.44 of 2022) which provide for the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme. The date specified is 18 December 2022.\"\n\nHowever, this passage does not mention the time limit for the duration of the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme. \n\nThe passage that mentions the specified period for the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme is:\n\n\"This Order specifies the commencement date for the purposes of section 7 of Finance Act 2023 (No. 11 of 2023) which provides for the amendment of sections 100 and 101 of Finance Act 2022 (Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme). The date specified is 17 May 2023.\"\n\nThis passage implies that the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme was in operation before 17 May 2023, but it does not provide a specific time limit for the duration of the scheme.\n\nSince the question asks for the time limit established by this Order for the duration of the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme under section 101(1) of the Finance Act 2022, and the provided passages do not explicitly state this information, we cannot determine the exact time limit from the given passages.\n\nHowever, based on the passage that mentions the specified date for the purposes of Section 101 of the Finance Act 2022, it can be inferred that the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme was in operation until 18 December 2022.",

    "Answer": "Based on the provided passages, it appears that there are two different orders mentioned, the Finance Act 2022 (Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme) (Specified Period) (No. 2) Order 2023 and the Finance Act 2022 (Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme) (Specified Period) Order 2023.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the authority under which the Finance Act 2022 (Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme) (Specified Period) (No. 2) Order 2023 was made, I will provide the answer based on the assumption that the correct order is the one mentioned in the question.\n\nThe Finance Act 2022 (Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme) (Specified Period) (No. 2) Order 2023 was made under the authority of the Finance Act 2022.\n\nUnfortunately, the passages do not provide information on who executed the order.",

    "Answer": "According to Regulation 5, the types of activities within the Lower River Shannon Special Area of Conservation that require ministerial consent are those specified in Schedule 4.\n\nHowever, there is a statutory exception that applies under paragraph (2) of Regulation 5. Specifically, a person is not required to obtain ministerial consent under paragraph (1) if the proposed or continued activity falls under one of the following categories:\n\n- (a) The activity requires consent or consents under one or more of the enactments set out in the Second Schedule to the Regulations of 2011 or under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2015, and the activity is carried out with and in compliance with such consent or consents.\n- (b) There is no specific information provided in the passage for option (b).\n- (c) The activity is part of a project that has received consent under one or more of the enactments set out in the Second Schedule to the Regulations of 2011 or under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2015, and the project or activity is carried out with and in compliance with a consent or consents given under the applicable statutes.\n- (d) The activity has been authorised as part of an agreed farm or land management plan.\n\nIn all these cases, the requirement for ministerial consent under Regulation 5(1) is waived, and the person can proceed with the activity without obtaining consent from the Minister.",

    "Answer": "Unfortunately, the passage provided does not contain the information regarding the specific offences and penalties created under Regulation 6 of these Regulations. However, it does provide the penalties for a person guilty of an offence under Regulation 6.\n\nTo answer the question, we would need more information from the Regulations.

    ],
    "Answer": "To determine which specific social work activities are designated as industrial activities for the purposes of the Industrial Training Act 1967 under this Order, we need to examine the passages provided.\n\nFrom the first passage, the following social work activities are designated as industrial activities:\n\n- The conduct of social work assessments of risk and protective factors impacting the safety and welfare of children and adults;\n- The design, management, supervision, and review of care and/or intervention plans;\n- The delivery of social work interventions for individuals, families, and communities;\n- The preparation of reports regarding the protection and welfare of children and adults at risk or in need of social services.\n\nFrom the second passage, the following social work activities are designated as industrial activities:\n\n- The conduct and documentation of social care assessments;\n- The design, provision, and review of social care plans or supports;\n- The coordination, implementation, and supervision of social care interventions in a residential or community care setting.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the Industrial Training Act 1967 (No. 5 of 1967) is the primary legislation governing this Order. Therefore, we must consider the activities listed in both passages in the context of this Act.\n\nUpon examination, we can see that the activities listed in both passages are related to social work and social care. However, the key distinction lies in the terminology used: \"social work\" in the first passage and \"social care\" in the second passage.\n\nGiven that the Industrial Training Act 1967 (No. 5 of 1967) is the governing legislation, it is likely that the Order is intended to cover a broader range of social care activities. Therefore, the activities listed in both passages can be considered as designated industrial activities for the purposes of the Industrial Training Act 1967 under this Order.\n\nIn conclusion, the specific social work activities designated as industrial activities for the purposes of the Industrial Training Act 1967 under this Order are:\n\n- The conduct of social work assessments of risk and protective factors impacting the safety and welfare of children and adults;\n- The design, management, supervision, and review of care and/or intervention plans;\n- The delivery of social work interventions for individuals, families, and communities;\n- The preparation of reports regarding the protection and welfare of children and adults at risk or in need of social services;\n- The conduct and documentation of social care assessments;\n- The design, provision, and review of social care plans or supports;\n- The coordination, implementation, and supervision of social care interventions in a residential or community care setting.",

    "Answer": "Based on the provided passage from the Wireless Telegraphy (Telemetry Licence) Regulations 2024 (S.I. No. 266 of 2024), the general conditions attached to a Wireless Telegraphy (Telemetry Licence) that a Licensee must comply with to avoid enforcement action are not explicitly stated. However, the passage does provide information on amendments made to the Regulations, including the insertion of new definitions and the substitution of certain terms.\n\nTo determine the general conditions attached to a Wireless Telegraphy (Telemetry Licence), it would be necessary to refer to the original Regulations or other relevant legislation, such as the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926, which is mentioned in the passage.\n\nHowever, the passage does provide some information on the terms and conditions of Telemetry Licences, including:\n\n* The definition of a Telemetry Licence, which includes Regional On-site Licences, Regional Local-area Licences, Regional Wide-area Licences, and National Licences.\n* The definition of a Telemetry Spectrum Lease Licence, which is a non-exclusive Licence granted under section 5 of the Act of 1926.\n* The application of the Regulations to Telemetry Licences and Telemetry Spectrum Lease Licences.\n* The insertion of new provisions regarding spectrum transfers and leases.\n\nIt is likely that the general conditions attached to a Wireless Telegraphy (Telemetry Licence) include compliance with these definitions and provisions, as well as any other requirements specified in the original Regulations or other relevant legislation.",

    "Answer": "The passage provided does not explicitly define 'approved institutions' for purposes of grant eligibility under the Student Support Act 2011.

However, based on the context, it is likely that the definition of 'approved institutions' can be found in the principal Regulations.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question would be:\n\nThe definition of 'approved institutions' for purposes of grant eligibility under the Student Support Act 2011 is not explicitly provided in the passage, but it can be found in the principal Regulations (S.I.

    "Answer": "To address the question of how statutory references to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should be construed after this Order takes effect, we must consider the relevant passages.\n\nFirstly, passage 7 states that references to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment contained in the memorandum and articles of association of any company and relating to any function transferred by this Order shall, on and after the commencement of this Order, be construed as references to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.\n\nHowever, passage 4(a) of the 2020 Statutory Instrument states that references to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation shall be construed as references to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. \n\nPassage 4(b) of the 2020 Statutory Instrument states that references to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation shall be construed as references to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.\n\nPassage 4 of the 2025 Statutory Instrument states that references to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment shall be construed as references to the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment and the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment, respectively.\n\nConsidering these passages, the correct interpretation is that statutory references to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should be construed as follows:\n\n- References to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment shall be construed as references to the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment, as per passage 4 of the 2025 Statutory Instrument.\n- References to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment contained in the memorandum and articles of association of any company and relating to any function transferred by this Order shall, on and after the commencement of this Order, be construed as references to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, as per passage 7.\n- In all other cases, references to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment shall be construed as references to the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment, as per passage 4 of the 2025 Statutory Instrument.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that statutory references to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should be construed as follows, depending on the context:\n\n- Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment: Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment\n- Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (in the context of company memorandum and articles of association and functions transferred by this Order): Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science\n- Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (in all other cases): Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment",

This amendment \nis on the basis that such plans (e.g. regional spatial and economic strategies, \ndevelopment plans) will be subject to appropriate assessment requirements \nunder Chapter 2 of Part 6 of the Act of 2024 and therefore should not be within \nscope of the appropriate assessment requirements that apply to plans under the \n2011 Regulations (except where the contrary intention appears). \n\n \n \n \n \n\f4 [451] \n\nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH \nARNA FHOILSIÚ AG OIFIG AN tSOLÁTHAIR \nLe ceannach díreach ó \nFOILSEACHÁIN RIALTAIS, \nBÓTHAR BHAILE UÍ BHEOLÁIN, \nCILL MHAIGHNEANN, \nBAILE ÁTHA CLIATH 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTeil: 046 942 3100 \nr-phost: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\nDUBLIN \nPUBLISHED BY THE STATIONERY OFFICE \nTo be purchased from \nGOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, \nMOUNTSHANNON ROAD, \nKILMAINHAM, DUBLIN 8, \nD08 XAO6 \n\nTel: 046 942 3100 \nE-mail: publications@opw.ie \n—————— \n\n€ 1.50 \n\n(PLRU-17) 30. 10/25.

    "Answer": "According to the Explanatory Note, plans within the meaning of section 198 of the Planning and Development Act 2024 are excluded from the scope of the 2011 Regulations' appropriate assessment requirements (save where a contrary intention appears) because such plans (e.g. regional spatial and economic strategies, development plans) will be subject to appropriate assessment requirements under Chapter 2 of Part 6 of the Act of 2024. As a result, they should not be within the scope of the appropriate assessment requirements that apply to plans under the 2011 Regulations (except where the contrary intention appears).",
